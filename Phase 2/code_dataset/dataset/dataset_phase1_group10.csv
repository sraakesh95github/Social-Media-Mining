Pakistan’s Most Terrifying Adversary Is Climate Change,"Karachi is home. My bustling, chaotic city of about 20 million people on the Arabian Sea is an ethnically and religiously diverse metropolis and the commercial capital of Pakistan, generating more than half of the country’s revenue.Over the decades, Karachi has survived violent sectarian strife, political violence between warring groups claiming the city and terrorism. Karachi has survived its gangsters sparring with rocket launchers; its police force, more feared than common criminals; its rulers and bureaucrats committed to rapacious, bottomless corruption. Now Karachi faces its most terrifying adversary: climate change.In August, Karachi’s stifling summer heat was heavy and pregnant. The sapodilla trees and frangipani leaves were lush and green; the Arabian Sea, quiet and distant, had grown muddy. When the palm fronds started to sway, slowly, the city knew the winds had picked up and rain would follow. Every year the monsoons come — angrier and wilder — lashing the unprepared city. Studies show that climate change is causing monsoons to be more intense and less predictable, and cover larger areas of land for longer periods of time.On Aug. 27, Karachi received nearly nine inches of monsoon rain, the highest amount of rainfall ever in a single day. Nineteen inches of rain fell in August, according to the meteorological officials. It is enough to drown a city that has no functioning drainage, no emergency systems and no reliable health care (except for those who can pay). Thousands of homes and settlements of the poor were subsumed and destroyed, and more than 100 people were killed.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA traders association estimated that the submerging of markets and warehouses damaged goods worth 25 billion Pakistani rupees, or about $150 million. Local papers estimated that with Karachi at a standstill for a week, in some congested areas for longer, Pakistan’s gross domestic product suffered daily losses of $449 million — a number that didn’t include the enormous informal economy. The World Bank estimates that 15 percent of gross domestic product of the Sindh province (Karachi is its capital) is lost every year to environmental damage and climate change.Pakistan is the fifth most climate vulnerable nation in the world. Between 1998 and 2018, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, the country is estimated to have lost nearly 10,000 lives to climate-related disasters and suffered losses amounting to about $4 billion from 152 extreme weather events in that period. Analysts have estimated Pakistan’s climate migrants over the past decade at around 30 million people.ImageA funeral being held in Karachi, Pakistan, in August for some victims of the flood caused by relentless monsoon rains.Credit...Fareed Khan/Associated PressThere is no end to the catalog of climate disasters affecting my country. The glaciers in the Hindu Kush, the Himalayas and the Karakoram in northern Pakistan are melting at an accelerated pace. If the emission trends and temperature rises continue unabated, these mountains could lose between a third to two-thirds of their ice fields by 2100. The result will be catastrophic: By 2050, the increased melting will result in landslides, heavy flooding, dam bursts and soil erosion. After the glaciers have melted away, drought and famine will follow.The terror of our coming era will be born of heat and fire and ice. Some years ago, I was in a village in Sindh after a massive flood had devastated it. Thousands were displaced overnight. The blistering heat soaked the faces of displaced young women in sweat thick like glycerin. I was unsure what would be more lethal — the drowning or the heat.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNot far from that drowned village in Sindh is the city of Jacobabad, where temperatures in the summer run as high as 124 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world’s deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet’s climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.Pakistan’s current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women’s modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.Karachi’s rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn’t watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi’s ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.Fatima Bhutto, an essayist and novelist from Pakistan, is the author, most recently, of the novel “The Runaways.”",nytimes,"Pakistan’s Most Terrifying Adversary Is Climate Change‬s Climate Deniers' War: A Brought-on Climate Wars Learn more More (13:57) @chapabito1 writes: ‪‎That is the least horrific thing we've ever seen before"" I agree with you.

Ocean Heat Waves Are Directly Linked to Climate Change,"Six years ago, a huge part of the Pacific Ocean near North America quickly warmed, reaching temperatures more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Nicknamed “the blob,” it persisted for two years, with devastating impacts on marine life, including sea lions and salmon.The blob was a marine heat wave, the oceanic equivalent of a deadly summer atmospheric one. It was far from a solitary event: Tens of thousands have occurred in the past four decades, although most are far smaller and last for days rather than years. The largest and longest ones have occurred with increasing frequency over time.On Thursday, scientists revealed the culprit. Climate change, they said, is making severe marine heat waves much more likely.The study, published in the journal Science, looked at the blob and six other large events around the world, including one in the Northwest Atlantic in 2012. Human-caused global warming made these events at least 20 times more likely, the researchers found.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Some of these couldn’t even have occurred without climate change,” said Charlotte Laufkötter, a marine scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland and the lead author of the study.In a world with no human-caused warming, a large marine heat wave would have had about a one-tenth of 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year — what is called a thousand-year event. But with the current rate of global warming, an ocean heat wave like that could soon have as much as a 10 percent chance of occurring, the study found.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Dr. Laufkötter said the likelihood of these large events would continue to increase as the world keeps warming. And if emissions of greenhouse gases continue at a high level for decades and average global temperatures reach about 5 degrees above preindustrial levels, some parts of the oceans may be in a continuous state of extreme heat.In effect, the blob may become permanent. Already, a marine heat wave resembling the blob has emerged in the past year off northwestern North America.Pippa Moore, a marine ecologist at Newcastle University in England who was not involved in the study, said earlier research had found links between climate change and major marine heat waves.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySo the new study isn’t surprising, she said. “But what’s really nice is they’ve done a formal attribution study that shows it.”An attribution study looks for the connection, if any, between climate change and extreme weather events by comparing simulations of the current warming world with simulations of a world in which human activity had not pumped billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. These kinds of studies have been done for many events on land, including atmospheric heat waves and extreme rainfall, but very few have been done on marine heat waves.The oceans absorb most of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But Dr. Moore, who studies the ecological impacts of these heat waves, said it is how fast the water warms, rather than its ultimate temperature, that is most damaging to marine organisms. “That rate of heat rising is just too quick for their physiology to cope with,” she said. “It leads to reduced growth rates, heightened risk of disease and greater mortality.”But for sea lions and some other creatures, she said, the effects may be indirect. The heat wave may cause a source of food to die off or migrate. Heat waves can also lead to toxic algae blooms that can kill fish.The events can affect humans, too. The blob in the Pacific may have influenced weather patterns on the West Coast, worsening drought in California, for example. The 2012 heat wave in the Atlantic affected the lobster harvest in the Gulf of Maine and raised trade tensions between the United States and Canada.There are many reasons the heat waves form, Dr. Moore said, including the influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions like El Niño. The blob was affected by a persistent ridge of high-pressure air over western North America that allowed stagnant air to linger over the ocean, leading to rapid warming.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyClimate Fwd: What on earth is going on? Get the latest news about climate change, plus tips on how you can help.Sign UpA separate study published on Tuesday in Nature Communications identified a novel mechanism by which a heat wave could develop: through the compounding effects of two successive extreme weather events.That study showed that a 2018 marine heat wave off the Gulf Coast formed when the passage of a tropical storm, Gordon, in early September was followed by an atmospheric heat wave.Brian Dzwonkowski, a researcher at the University of South Alabama and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, and the study’s lead author, said the tropical storm had stirred cold water up from the bottom, mixing it with warm surface water to make uniformly warm conditions. The atmospheric heat wave then warmed the waters further, putting them past the heat threshold that defines a marine heat wave.The relatively shallow coastal waters were “supercharged from top to bottom,” Dr. Dzwonkowski said.In mid-October another tropical cyclone, Hurricane Michael, came along. The warm water helped it rapidly strengthen to a powerful Category 5 storm, with a devastating result.

Hurricane Sally Is a Slow-Moving Threat. Climate Change Might Be Why.,"[Follow our live Hurricane Sally updates and our map tracker.]BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. — Hurricane Sally parked itself over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, churning slowly and lumbering at a sluggish pace toward land, representing a climate change reality that has made many hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous.Sally’s outer bands unleashed a relentless rain that began in the morning and continued unabated all day and into the night, threatening to deluge coastal communities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Meteorologists worried — and almost marveled — as the storm pushed forward at a speed of just 2 miles per hour, shifting erratically in its path and intensity.Scientists saw Sally’s stall over the warm waters of the Gulf as yet another effect of climate change in the United States, coming as wildfires along the West Coast have incinerated millions of acres and sent foul air into the atmosphere as far away as Washington, D.C. A scorching summer — made worse by the burning of fossil fuels, experts say — led to dry conditions that helped turn this year’s wildfires into the worst ever recorded.Map: Hurricane Sally’s Path and RainfallThe storm has released torrents of rain on the Gulf Coast.Fires were still burning out of control in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday, and air quality in the region — some of the worst in the world — prompted the closure of some schools, parks and beaches.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWith the authorities pleading with residents to stay indoors, the hunt for missing people continued in scorched communities.

Last month, Hurricane Laura tore across southwest Louisiana, leaving a trail of destruction and cutting electricity that has yet to be restored to many communities.Climate change has made hurricanes wetter and slower, scientists have found. Recent research suggests that global warming — specifically in the Arctic, which is warming much more rapidly than other regions — is playing a role in weakening atmospheric circulation and thus potentially affecting hurricane speed.A 2018 study found that since the middle of the 20th century, translation speeds of all hurricanes and tropical storms had decreased by about 10 percent. Another study that year that focused on Atlantic hurricanes found that the average speed of storms near the North American coast had slowed by more than 15 percent.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImageBeach Boulevard, which traces the coast in Pascagoula, Miss., was closed to traffic.Credit...William Widmer for The New York TimesIn Bayou La Batre, Ala., where Sally was already turning roads into rivers on Tuesday, Ernest Nelson, a retired commercial fisherman, reached a similar conclusion as he sought refuge under a house raised 10 feet off the ground on concrete pillars.Storms were getting bigger and more intense, he said. Mr. Nelson, who had worked the water for decades, gave his basis for that belief: “No meteorologist. No college degree. Experience.”On Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center reported that Sally’s translation speed, the rate at which it moves forward, was about 2 miles per hour, and that the storm was not expected to accelerate much as it moved northward in the Gulf of Mexico toward an expected landfall on Wednesday. It was stalling, in effect, as it approached the Mississippi coast.But rather than serve as a source of comfort, its languid speed only intensified the unease: Sally, which intensified into a Category 2 storm early Wednesday, is dangerous, meteorologists warned, precisely because it is so slow. Its lingering could translate into major flooding, with more rain than the region typically records over several months.Hurricane Paulette, by contrast, was zipping along in the Atlantic on Tuesday with a translation speed of more than 25 m.p.h. after passing Bermuda two days earlier.Other recent hurricanes have also stalled. A year ago, Dorian crawled over the Bahamas for a day and a half, causing widespread destruction from wind and storm surge. And Harvey, perhaps the best-known — and most costly — example of stalling, was no longer a hurricane by the time it slowed near Houston in August 2017. It had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but still it inundated the city and surrounding communities with four feet or more of rain over several days.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAs Sally churned in the Gulf, the conditions left many living along the coast perplexed and unnerved. No strangers to hurricanes, they weighed the risks of hunkering down against fleeing.ImageAn empty vehicle in a flooded driveway in Pascagoula.Credit...Lukas Flippo/The Sun Herald, via Associated PressThe confusion came from the storm’s apparent fickleness, as the forecast constantly evolved in recent days, with predictions that included reaching west of New Orleans or hitting Biloxi, Miss. On Tuesday evening, the forecast said it was continuing on a path aimed for Mobile Bay, Ala., likely making landfall Wednesday morning.Still, officials and meteorologists said there was a measure of certainty in the threat that Sally posed. The rainfall could reach as high as 30 inches in some areas from the Florida panhandle to Mississippi.The rainfall would compound a storm surge that could reach as high as four to six feet around Dauphin Island and the Mobile Bay on the Alabama coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters from the center also warned of life-threatening flash floods.“I can tell you from many years of experience and many times passed, I’ve seen streets and neighborhoods quickly fill up with five, six, seven and even more depth of water in a short period of time,” Sam Cochran, the Mobile County sheriff, said during a briefing on Tuesday.And if residents stay behind, he added, it might be “a couple of days or longer before we can get you out.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA hurricane warning remained in effect for an area stretching eastward from Bay St. Louis, Miss., near the Louisiana border, to Navarre, near the tip of the Florida panhandle — a distance that includes most of Mississippi’s and Alabama’s coastlines.A tropical storm warning covered the area west of the Pearl River to Grand Isle, La. — including metropolitan New Orleans — and east of Navarre to Indian Pass, Fla.Officials urged people living along the coast and in low-lying areas to clear out, taking advantage of the storm’s snail-like pace to avoid being trapped in floodwaters.Intense waterfalls of rain began pelting Mobile, an old port city of about 190,000 people, on Tuesday morning. The streets were mostly empty, but many residents had chosen to stay home to ride out a storm that was expected to deposit more than two feet of rain.Alonzo Johnson, a high school football coach, was sitting on the front porch of the 80-year-old Craftsman home where he lives with his family south of downtown. There was nothing to do but watch the rain and see how high it would go. Mr. Johnson, 47, said that floodwaters had gone to the bottom of a stop sign across the street in the past. During Katrina, the water had lapped up to the top of his porch, about two feet off the ground.“We’re anxious,” he said. If the water gets high enough, the family would retreat to the back of the house, which is a bit higher. “We’ll find a safe space where we can get to praying.”ImageIf the water gets too high in Mobile, Ala., Alonzo Johnson and his family would retreat to the back of the house. “We’ll find a safe space where we can get to praying,” he said.Credit...William Widmer for The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn the oyster and fishing town of Bayou La Batre, how Mr. Nelson found himself under a house, and how the house got built in the first place, was tangled in the long, painful drama of a changing climate that has irrevocably complicated life along the Gulf Coast.Mr. Nelson, 66, had been living more than 300 miles west of Bayou La Batre, in the small Louisiana town of Hackberry. But a few weeks ago, Hurricane Laura roared out of the Gulf and devastated Hackberry, including Mr. Nelson’s home, a little travel trailer right on the water.“You’re looking at the last person to get out of Hackberry,” said Mr. Nelson, who made his escape just before Laura’s landfall, when his sister Stephenie Bosarge, 63, picked him up and brought him to her elevated home just off the water on the Alabama shore.A different house had been on the property before Hurricane Katrina blew it away in 2005, along with Ms. Bosarge’s wedding bands, family photos and oyster shop. The Volunteers of America came through town and built her this new raised house a few blocks from the water.Since Katrina, many houses in Bayou La Batre are now jacked up on stilts, and people have their ways of figuring out what to do with all that space below, parking a truck or boat, stashing junk or storing tools. At her house, Ms. Bosarge installed a tiki bar, some porch swings and a stereo system.Soon, they planned on evacuating, riding out the storm with a relative on higher ground in Grand Bay. But for the time being, the siblings sat on their porch swings, watching this new slow-moving disaster unfold around them, wondering how high the water would rise and joking about Mr. Nelson’s bad fortune.But they were serious about what had happened to their way of life, and the life of so many other Gulf people. “It is coming to an end,” Ms. Bosarge said. “Baby, I knew that years ago.”Richard Fausset reported from Bayou La Batre, Rick Rojas from Atlanta, and Henry Fountain from Albuquerque.

The Wildfires Show That Stopping Climate Change Is No Longer Enough,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.Gov. Gavin Newsom, standing in an ash-coated clearing scorched by the largest wildfires in California’s recorded history, last week vowed to fast-track his state’s transition to 100 percent renewable energy, a target previously set for 2045. “This is a climate damn emergency,” he declared.Such commitments may be necessary for the global effort to stop climate change, but as Mr. Newsom seemed to acknowledge, they are no longer sufficient to prevent megafires of the kind now burning the American West and poisoning its skies. Scientists have estimated that even if aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were made today, it would still take decades for them to have any noticeable effect on rising temperatures.“If the fires of 2020 horrify you, as they should,” David Wallace-Wells writes for New York magazine, “consider that by 2050, when the benefits of fast climate action will only begin to arrive, the area burned annually in the West is expected to have at least doubled, and perhaps quadrupled.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyGiven this grim prognosis, how can the West minimize the loss of life and destruction that global warming is already causing, and what do other U.S. regions need to do to adapt? Here’s what people are saying.Fighting fire with fire (and policy)Fixing forest managementPresident Trump has rejected the scientific consensus about the clear relationship between the changing climate and intensifying wildfires, instead seeking to blame poor forest management. Many argue there is a kernel of truth to the latter claim, even if it implicates Mr. Trump and his predecessors, since most of California’s and Oregon’s forests are federally held.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.For more than a century, the State of California has treated wildfires as unqualified threats, extinguishing them whenever they occur. But the problem with that strategy, Elizabeth Weil writes for ProPublica, is that California is naturally primed to catch fire: Before Euro-American settlement in the 1800s, fires burned about 1.5 million of California’s 100 million acres every year. After decades of aggressive fire suppression, forests once periodically cleared by less intense wildfires are now blanketed with natural fuel.“We dug ourselves into a deep, dangerous fuel imbalance due to one simple fact,” Ms. Weil writes. “We live in a Mediterranean climate that’s designed to burn, and we’ve prevented it from burning anywhere close to enough for well over 100 years. Now climate change has made it hotter and drier than ever before, and the fire we’ve been forestalling is going to happen, fast, whether we plan for it or not.”Ecologists, forest managers and firefighters Ms. Weil spoke to agreed on one vital solution: To control fires, humans have to start more themselves. As my colleague Jill Cowan explains, California’s Native American tribes had for thousands of years used controlled fires to keep wild ones in check. As of 2017, though, only 13,000 acres per year are subject to prescribed burns in California, and the practice is similarly rare in Oregon and Washington.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe challenge posed by the backlog is staggering: To bring California’s fires back under control, researchers at Stanford estimated that the state might need to burn or thin a fifth of its land, an area about the size of Maine.Lack of funding and opposition among residents make prescribed burns a politically difficult proposition, Ms. Cowan explains, but the alternative is the crisis playing out before us. “The big picture solution is realizing there is going to be a lot more fire on the landscape,” Daniel Swain, a California climate expert, told her. “I don’t see how we get out of this without allowing a lot more to burn.”Building more resilient housingAs the former Times climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis wrote in 2018, many of the deadliest and costliest fires start not in the heart of isolated forests but at the wildland-urban interface, where developed and undeveloped land meet. About 44 million houses, equivalent to one in every three in the country, are in these zones, and the number is rising particularly fast in California. Wildfires already pose the greatest danger to people in the wildland-urban interface, and their presence there tends to increase the number of fires that start in the first place.Experts say that governments could impose regulations to make housing developments more resilient, including stipulations for fire-resistant building materials and moats of cleared vegetation known as defensible space. California adopted many of these standards, some of the strictest in the country, in 2008. One analysis of the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in 2018 determined that about 51 percent of the 350 single-family homes built to the new codes escaped damage, compared with just 18 percent of the 12,100 homes built earlier.But there are considerable obstacles to making such fortifications more widespread. In many states, developers have resisted new regulations. Retrofitting the millions of houses already built can be prohibitively expensive. And in the aftermath of a fire, the pressure to rebuild often wins out over safety considerations.“At this point we’ve learned a lot about how to engineer homes and communities so that they can be more survivable,” said Max Moritz, a wildfire expert affiliated with the University of California, Santa Barbara. “But these lessons aren’t being implemented fast enough.”Debatable: Agree to disagree, or disagree better? Broaden your perspective with sharp arguments on the most pressing issues of the week.Sign UpAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyUnsprawling the suburbsLast year, The Los Angeles Times editorial board repeated the call for increased fire resiliency, but argued that it was foolish to pretend that housing regulations would eliminate the danger created by building and rebuilding in high-fire-risk areas. “Cities and state agencies are talking about ‘managed retreat’ — or relocating threatened homes — from communities facing coastal erosion or flooding,” the board wrote. “Why is there not a similar policy discussion in areas that repeatedly burn?”One reason, as Mr. Newsom put it, is that the notion runs counter to California’s “pioneering spirit.” Another reason, as the Times editorial board wrote last year, is that California’s sprawl is driven in part by soaring housing prices that have pushed people out of cities. Prohibitions against building in fire-prone areas would therefore entail building denser, affordable housing in urban economic centers.To the Times columnist Farhad Manjoo, the challenge that lies before the state is nothing less than a transformation of its way of life. “Californian suburbia, the ideal of much of American suburbia, was built and sold on the promise of endless excess — everyone gets a car, a job, a single-family home and enough water and gasoline and electricity to light up the party,” he writes. “But it is long past obvious that infinitude was a false promise. Traffic, sprawl, homelessness and ballooning housing costs are all consequences of our profligacy with the land and our other resources.”Updating the fire safety curriculumWhile some devastating fires are caused by negligent utility companies and natural causes, most are caused, intentionally or unintentionally, by people. In Washington State, for example, people have started more than 1,300 fires so far this year. The Seattle Times editorial board argues that climate change has only increased the need to cultivate a more rigorous ethic of fire prevention among the public.“Vigilance about fire safety must be an everyday concern. From cigarette butts tossed on the roadside to campfires and fire pits, each outdoor spark is a threat to bucolic wild lands, property and life during these long parched weeks,” the board writes. “Every Washington resident and business shares this responsibility. Schools and public-safety bulletins should urgently spread this gospel. The message must be amplified each summer.”Thinking beyond the West CoastIn the coming decades, no part of the United States will remain unaffected by climate change. As Abrahm Lustgarten writes in The New York Times Magazine, Americans have been conditioned not to respond to climate threats as people in the rest of the world do, possessed of a boundless faith in the capacity of money and technology to domesticate nature. But across the country, he says, not just in the West, the gap between what the climate can destroy and what money can replace is growing.Florida officials have already acknowledged that safeguarding some roadways against rising seas will be unaffordable. In recent years, the Southeast has had to contend with what may be the emergence of its own dangerous annual fire season. And for the first time, the nation’s federal flood-insurance program is now mandating that some of its payouts be used to retreat from damage-prone areas. The insurance, real estate and private-equity industries are beginning to register the risk, he writes, and “it will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhat replaces it is still an open question. According to a federal report, the United States will need to spend billions of dollars to fortify its coastlines, rebuild its sewer systems, rethink its farming practices and potentially relocate millions of people from the coasts. What adaptation looks like will vary region by region, but writ large, Matt Shaw argues in ",nytimes,"The Wildfires Show That Stopping Climate Change Is No Longer Enough"".The media campaign has gone off the rails, and the media are never so safe as to finally commit themselves to putting the blame squarely on President Obama.

U.S. and European Oil Giants Go Different Ways on Climate Change,"HOUSTON — As oil prices plunge and concerns about climate change grow, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and other European energy companies are selling off oil fields, planning a sharp reduction in emissions and investing billions in renewable energy.The American oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil are going in a far different direction. They are doubling down on oil and natural gas and investing what amounts to pocket change in innovative climate-oriented efforts like small nuclear power plants and devices that suck carbon out of the air.The disparity reflects the vast differences in how Europe and the United States are approaching climate change, a global threat that many scientists say is increasing the frequency and severity of disasters like wildfires and hurricanes. European leaders have made tackling climate change a top priority while President Trump has called it a “hoax” and has dismantled environmental regulations to encourage the exploitation of fossil fuels.As world leaders struggle to adopt coordinated and effective climate policies, the choices made by oil companies, with their deep pockets, science prowess, experience in managing big engineering projects and lobbying muscle may be critical. What they do could help determine whether the world can meet the goals of the Paris agreement to limit the increase of global temperatures to below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe big American and European oil and gas companies publicly agree that climate change is a threat and that they must play a role in the kind of energy transition the world last saw during the industrial revolution. But the urgency with which the companies are planning to transform their businesses could not be more different.“Despite rising emissions and societal demand for climate action, U.S. oil majors are betting on a long-term future for oil and gas, while the European majors are gambling on a future as electricity providers,” said David Goldwyn, a top State Department energy official in the Obama administration. “The way the market reacts to their strategies and the 2020 election results will determine whether either strategy works.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.To environmentalists and even some Wall Street investors, the American oil giants are clearly making the wrong call. In August, for example, Storebrand Asset Management, Norway’s largest private money manager, divested from Exxon Mobil and Chevron. And Larry Fink, who leads the world’s largest investment manager, BlackRock, has called climate change “a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects.”European oil executives, by contrast, have said that the age of fossil fuels is dimming and that they are planning to leave many of their reserves buried forever. They also argue that they must protect their shareholders by preparing for a future in which governments enact tougher environmental policies.BP is the standard-bearer for the hurry-up-and-change strategy. The company has announced that over the next decade it will increase investments in low-emission businesses tenfold, to $5 billion a year, while shrinking its oil and gas production by 40 percent. Royal Dutch Shell, Eni of Italy, Total of France, Repsol of Spain and Equinor of Norway have set similar targets. Several of those companies have cut their dividends to invest in new energy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBP tried a transition in the late 1990s and early 2000s under the leadership of John Browne, then chief executive, but financial results from renewables were disappointing, and the company eventually dropped its moniker “Beyond Petroleum.”In an interview, Mr. Browne said this time would be different. “There are many more voices now,” he said, adding that the Paris agreement was a watershed, that the economics of renewables have improved and that investor pressure was building.This month, BP and Equinor announced a partnership to build and operate wind projects along the coasts of New York and Massachusetts. The governors of those states want to reduce their reliance on natural gas, which this effort will aid.American oil executives say it would be folly for them to switch to renewables, arguing that it is a low-profit business that utilities and alternative energy companies can pursue more effectively. They say it is only a matter of time before oil and gas prices recover as the pandemic recedes.ImageCredit...Alana Paterson for The New York TimesFor now, Exxon and Chevron are sticking to what they know best, shale drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, deepwater offshore production and trading natural gas. In fact, Chevron is acquiring a smaller oil company, Noble Energy, to increase its reserves.“Our strategy is not to follow the Europeans,” said Daniel Droog, Chevron’s vice president for energy transition. “Our strategy is to decarbonize our existing assets in the most cost-effective way and consistently bring in new technology and new forms of energy. But we’re not asking our investors to sacrifice return or go forward with three decades of uncertainty on dividends.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyChevron says it is increasing its own use of renewable energy to power its operations. It also says it is reducing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And the company has invested more than $1.1 billion in various projects to capture and sequester carbon so it isn’t released into the atmosphere.Its venture capital arm, Chevron Technology Ventures, is investing in new-energy start-ups like Zap Energy, which is developing modular fusion nuclear reactors that release no greenhouse gases and limit radioactive waste. Another, Carbon Engineering, removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to convert into fuel.All told, Chevron Technology Ventures has two funds with a total of $200 million, about 1 percent of the company’s capital and exploration budget last year. The company has a separate $100 million fund to support a $1 billion investment consortium that aims to reduce emissions across the oil and gas industry.“We need breakthrough technology, and my job is to go find it,” said Barbara Burger, president of Chevron Technology Ventures, which employs 60 of Chevron’s 44,000 employees. “The transition is not an 11:59-on-Tuesday event. It’s going to be gradual, and evolving and continual over decades.”Exxon has also largely steered away from renewables and has instead invested in roughly one-third of the world’s limited carbon-capture capacity, which has been so expensive and energy intensive that few companies have been willing to underwrite large-scale projects.It spends about $1 billion a year on research and development, much of which goes to developing new energy technologies and efficiency improvements that reduce emissions.One project involves directing carbon emitted from industrial operations into a fuel cell that can generate power. That should reduce emissions while increasing energy production.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn a separate experiment, Exxon recently announced a “big advance” with scientists at University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for developing materials that help capture carbon dioxide from natural-gas power plants with less heating and cooling than previous methods.ImageCarbon Engineering, in which Chevron has invested, converts carbon dioxide into fuel.Credit...Alana Paterson for The New York TimesImageExxon Mobil is working on algae strains whose oils can fuel trucks and airplanes.Credit...Sandy Huffaker for The New York TimesThe company is also working on strains of algae whose oils can produce biofuel for trucks and airplanes. The plants also absorb carbon through photosynthesis, which Exxon scientists are trying to speed up while producing more oil.“Step 1, you have to do the science, and it is impossible to put a deadline on discovery,” said Vijay Swarup, Exxon’s vice president for research and development.Research into fusion, algae and carbon capture has been going on for decades, and many climate experts say those technologies could take decades more to commercialize. That’s why many scholars and environmentalists feel the American oil companies are not serious about tackling climate change.“Oil companies don’t do things that put themselves out of business,” said David Keith, a Harvard professor of applied physics who founded Carbon Engineering. “That is not the way the world works.”But some energy analysts argue that the American oil companies are right not to rush to change their businesses. They argue that U.S. lawmakers have simply not given them enough incentives to make a radical break.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If this is the sunset time for oil and gas, someone forgot to tell consumers,” said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, a research and consulting firm. He said that while sales of electric cars may have picked up, it would take decades to replace the more than a billion internal-combustion cars on the road now.It will probably take just as long, if not longer, to replace the large fleets of trucks, airplanes and ships that run on fossil fuels. There ought to be enough demand for oil over the next 30 to 40 years for Exxon and Chevron to exploit their reserves and make money, though the profits will decline over time, said Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who studies energy policy.“Investors can invest in Tesla or any renewable or electric company,” he said. “Why should an oil firm with the skills for large-scale hydrocarbon developments be able to compete against these new players?”But Mr. Helm, who published the book “Burn Out: The End Game for Fossil Fuels” in 2017, said he believed that all oil companies had a dim future beyond the next few decades because technology advances would make them obsolete in a world economy dominated by electricity, battery storage, three-dimensional printing, robotics and other breakthroughs. “These companies, in the end, will die.”",nytimes,"U.S. and European Oil Giants Go Different Ways on Climate Change"".The global leadership in addressing climate change needs to stop focusing on simple issues and put much deeper steps, such as aggressive policy action and negotiation, into the 2030 Agenda.

‘Nothing to Do With Climate Change’: Conservative Media and Trump Align on Fires,"Rush Limbaugh told millions of his radio listeners to set aside any suggestion that climate change was the culprit for the frightening spate of wildfires ravaging California and the Pacific Northwest.“Man-made global warming is not a scientific certainty; it cannot be proven, nor has it ever been,” Mr. Limbaugh declared on his Friday show, disregarding the mountains of empirical evidence to the contrary. He then pivoted to a popular right-wing talking point: that policies meant to curtail climate change are, in fact, an assault on freedom.“Environmentalist wackos” — Mr. Limbaugh’s phrase — “want man to be responsible for it because they want to control your behavior,” the conservative host said on the show. He added that they “want to convince you that your lifestyle choices are the reason why all these fires are firing up out on the Left Coast.”Hours later, that message leapt to prime time on Fox News, where the host Tucker Carlson said those who blamed climate change for the fires were merely reciting “a partisan talking point.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“In the hands of Democratic politicians, climate change is like systemic racism in the sky,” Mr. Carlson told viewers. “You can’t see it, but rest assured, it’s everywhere, and it’s deadly. And like systemic racism, it is your fault.”Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Carlson are two of the most prominent commentators in the right-wing media sphere, where a rich history of climate denialism has merged with Trump-era cultural warfare to generate a deep skepticism of the notion that climate change is a factor in the fires devastating the West Coast.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Like President Trump, conservative media stars dismiss climate change — which scientists say is the primary cause of the conflagration — and point to the poor management of forestland by local (and, conveniently, Democratic) officials. Fringe right-wing websites, like The Gateway Pundit, have blamed left-wing arsonists, fueling false rumors that authorities say are impeding rescue efforts.Visiting California on Monday to witness the destruction firsthand, Mr. Trump took Western states to task for failing to manage the forests properly.

Control you. Beat you down. You need to change your lifestyle, need to confess to something.”Some right-wing writers see even darker origins in the outbreak of a lethal blaze.The Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy website with a healthy online following — its chief writer, Jim Hoft, was welcomed to the White House by Mr. Trump — published posts asserting that left-wing anarchists were to blame, not the environment.“Many arsonists have already been arrested in Oregon, Washington and California, but the Democrats continue to blame the wildfires on climate change,” a Gateway Pundit story said on Monday, alongside a video purportedly showing a woman in Oregon confronting an arsonist on her property.

Asked on Tuesday’s “Fox & Friends” about his policy plans for fighting climate change, the president replied: “You have forests all over the world. You don’t have fires like you do in California.”Californians have been debating how to reduce the risk of deadly blazes, with some officials arguing for more controlled burns.

About 58 percent of California forestland is controlled by the federal government; the state owns 3 percent.For environmental advocacy groups, problematic media coverage of the wildfires is not limited to platforms associated with the right.The Environmental Defense Fund, in a scathing post, said many mainstream news outlets had failed to draw a direct link between the widespread destruction and the dangerous consequences of a changing climate.“It is like talking about the increased spread of Covid while ignoring the reason it is spreading,” the group wrote.",nytimes,"‘Nothing to Do With Climate Change’: Conservative Media and Trump Align on Fires at CampusSPONSOREDThe conservative media outlet The Washington Post reported Sunday that Donald Trump fired back at a campus Republicans who responded to his call by saying the U.S. government should step in to contain rising sea levels and so turn around the planet.""President Obama said last Sunday that climate change is inevitable, but scientists would not explain the crisis in climate change,"" Obama said.

Hurricane Sally’s Fierce Rain Shows How Climate Change Raises Storm Risks,"As hurricanes go, Sally was not especially powerful. Rated a Category 2 storm when it struck the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, it was soon downgraded. But climate change likely made it more dangerous by slowing it down and feeding it more moisture, setting it up to pummel the region with wind and catastrophic rainfall.Sally was crawling at about 3 miles per hour when its eye made landfall early Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Ala., and was “inching its way inland” later in the day, the National Hurricane Center said. The slow movement, or stalling, of the storm led to staggering rain totals, with more than two feet in some areas by midmorning Wednesday and widespread flooding.“When a storm moves slower, it lingers longer over the same location,” said Kimberly Wood, a geoscientist at Mississippi State University. “A rain rate of, say, an inch an hour — that’s not so bad if the rain only lasts 30 minutes. But if it lasts for half a day, that adds up quickly.”Sally was not an isolated example of a stalling hurricane. “There is increasing evidence that storms are slowing down,” Dr. Wood said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThat evidence comes in part from a 2018 study that showed that hurricanes near the Gulf and Atlantic coasts were increasingly likely to stall. The study also found a clear signal of more local rainfall, said one of the authors, James P. Kossin, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “And it was associated with increasing frequency of stalled systems,” he said.Climate change has also led to wetter storms, Dr. Wood said, because warmer air holds more moisture. Between the slowing speeds and increasing moisture, with storms like Sally “there’s a combination effect,” she said.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Researchers increasingly see a link between stalling of hurricanes and climate change. Rapid warming in the Arctic has reduced the difference in temperature between that region and the tropics, leading to a weakening and slowing of the jet stream and related  winds that drive hurricanes’ forward movement.Hurricanes also sometimes meander, Dr. Kossin said. Hurricane Harvey, which inundated Houston in 2017, moved back and forth over the area, increasing the deluge. Sally was heading due west, parallel to the coast, on Monday when it made a sudden right-angle turn to the north early Tuesday.Such movements may also be linked to slowing atmospheric circulation, Dr. Kossin said. “You won’t really get meandering until you get a slow storm,” he said. “They don’t go zipping around like go-karts.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

In this case, Sally’s slow speed “contributed more to the extreme rainfall flooding than to the surge flooding,” said Rick Luettich, a professor at the University of North Carolina and a principal developer of the leading surge model used by forecasters.Dr. Luettich said the storm’s surge was close to projections of about five feet. But another characteristic of some hurricanes that is linked to warmer oceans, the rapid strengthening of a storm before landfall, “gave the water a bigger push” than earlier forecasts called for, he said.Hurricanes are not the only kind of storms affected by climate change, and not the only kind that can bring catastrophic flooding to the Gulf Coast or other regions. Record rain from a low-pressure system in August 2016, a large storm but one that did not rotate like a hurricane, led to floods in Baton Rouge. A gauge east of the city received 26.5 inches of rain in three days.That storm prompted an attribution study, research that tries to determine the extent, if any, of climate change’s influence on an extreme weather event. It found that climate change had increased the likelihood of such a storm along the Gulf Coast in any given year by 40 percent since 1900. In the current climate, there is a 3 percent chance in any given year of a similar storm.“The risk of extreme precipitation events in this region has gone up,” said Sarah Kapnick, a researcher at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., who worked on the study.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“There’s a basic theoretical understanding underlying all of this,” Dr. Kapnick said.

Federal Report Warns of Financial Havoc From Climate Change,"WASHINGTON — A report commissioned by federal regulators overseeing the nation’s commodities markets has concluded that climate change threatens U.S. financial markets, as the costs of wildfires, storms, droughts and floods spread through insurance and mortgage markets, pension funds and other financial institutions.“A world wracked by frequent and devastating shocks from climate change cannot sustain the fundamental conditions supporting our financial system,” concluded the report, “Managing Climate Risk in the Financial System,” which was requested last year by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and set for release on Wednesday morning.Those observations are not entirely new, but they carry new weight coming with the imprimatur of the regulator of complex financial instruments like futures, swaps and other derivatives that help fix the price of commodities like corn, oil and wheat. It is the first wide-ranging federal government study focused on the specific impacts of climate change on Wall Street.Perhaps most notable is that it is being published at all. The Trump administration has suppressed, altered or watered down government science around climate change as it pushes an aggressive agenda of environmental deregulation that it hopes will spur economic growth.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new report asserts that doing nothing to avert climate change will do the opposite.“This is the first time a government entity has looked at the impacts of climate change on financial markets in the U.S.,” said Robert Litterman, the chairman of the panel that produced the report and a founding partner of Kepos Capital, an investment firm based in New York. “Rather than saying, ‘What’s the science?’ this is saying, ‘What’s the financial risk?’”The commodities regulator, which is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, all of whom were appointed by President Trump, voted unanimously last summer to create an advisory panel drawn from the world of finance and charged with producing a report on the effects of the warming world on financial markets. The initial proposal for the report came from Rostin Behnam, one of the panel’s two Democrats, but the report is written by dozens of analysts from investment firms including Morgan Stanley, S&P Global and Vanguard; the oil companies BP and ConocoPhillips; and the agricultural trader Cargill, as well as academic experts and environmental groups.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.It includes recommendations for new corporate regulations and the reversal of at least one Trump administration policy.“It was shocking when they asked me to do this,” Mr. Litterman said. “This is members of the entire community involved in financial markets saying with one voice, ‘This is a serious problem, and it has to be addressed.’”A senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while the full commission had voted to produce the report, it has not yet voted to endorse its findings. “It doesn’t represent the position of the C.F.T.C. and is not an official government report,” the official said.

It is the only document of its type.”He added, “If you’re denying this exists, you don’t ask for a report on it.”The Republican chairman of the C.F.T.C., Heath Tarbert, acknowledged the risk of climate change, but he noted that the report also detailed what the regulators called “transition risk” — the financial harm that could befall the fossil fuel industry if the government enacted aggressive policies to curb carbon dioxide pollution.“I appreciate Commissioner Behnam’s leadership on convening various private sector perspectives on the important topic of climate risk,” Mr. Tarbert said in a statement. “The subcommittee’s report acknowledges that ‘transition risks’ of a green economy could be just as disruptive to our financial system as the possible physical manifestations of climate change, and that moving too fast, too soon could be just as disorderly as doing too little, too late. This underscores why it is so important for policymakers to get this right.”Some of the authors of the report acknowledged that if Mr. Trump is re-elected, his administration is all but certain to ignore the report and its recommendations.Instead, they said they saw the document as a policy road map for a Joseph R.

Agins/The New York TimesIn calling for climate-driven policy changes, the report’s authors likened the financial risk of global warming to the threat posed by the coronavirus today and by mortgage-backed securities that precipitated the financial crash in 2008.One crucial difference, they said, is that in the case of climate change, financial volatility and loss are likely to be spread out over time, as they hit different regions and markets. Insurance companies could withdraw from California in the wake of devastating wildfires, and home values could plummet on coastlines and in floodplains. In the Midwest, banks could limit loans during or after extended droughts that drastically lower crop yields. All of those problems will be exacerbated by climate change, but they are unlikely to hit all at once.“Financial markets are really good at managing risk to help us provide credit, so that the economy can flourish,” said Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, an editor of the report who served as senior official at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. But, he added, the system breaks down “when it’s no longer able to manage risk, when it’s invisible, it’s not captured by the price of stocks.”“That’s what we saw in the financial crisis of 2008, and it’s as relevant now on climate change as it was then on mortgage-backed securities,” he said.Among the first of those risks already pervading the markets, the report’s authors say, are falling home prices and rising mortgage default rates in regions where wildfires and flooding are worsening.“Climate change is linked to devaluing home values,” said Jesse Keenan, an editor of the report and a professor of real estate at Tulane University in New Orleans.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If in your town, your house is devalued, that makes it harder for your local government to raise money,” he said. “That’s one set of risks that could lead to a contagion and broader instability across financial markets.”Extreme weather could cause swings in agricultural commodity prices, the report warns, and climate-spurred market volatility could afflict pension and retirement funds, which invest across a range of asset classes.“Climate change is one of the top three risks to our fund,” said Divya Mankikar, an author of the report and an investment manager at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the country’s biggest public pension fund “We pay pension and health benefits to over two million current and former state employees. So the payout is decades out.”The report makes several concrete recommendations for inoculating the financial system against potential harm.It emphasizes the need to put a price on carbon emissions, which is often done either by taxing or through an emissions trading system that caps carbon emissions and allots credits that polluters can buy and sell under that cap.The report calls for the reversal of a proposed rule being put forward by the Trump administration’s Labor Department that would forbid retirement investment managers from considering environmental consequences in their financial recommendations.“If there’s any class of investors that should be thinking about the long run, it’s retirement funds and pension funds,” said Nathaniel Keohane, an author of the report and an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe report suggests that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a Treasury Department-led body created in the wake of the 2008 crisis, incorporates climate risks into its annual report and its communications with Congress. It suggests that the Federal Reserve and other major financial regulators join international coalitions that focus on climate threats.The report also suggests that bank regulators should roll out a climate risk stress testing pilot program. Such stress tests, which assess how bank balance sheets and the broader system would fare in bad climate-related economic scenarios, have been under development in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.The authors also recommend that another financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, strengthen its existing requirements that publicly traded companies disclose the risks to their bottom lines associated with climate change.Coca-Cola has noted in its financial disclosures that water shortages driven by climate change pose a risk to its production chains and profitability. But many other companies “just check the box” on that requirement, Mr. Keohane said.Such disclosures should also include the risk to companies’ bottom lines posed by future policies designed to mitigate climate change, such as taxes or regulations on carbon dioxide pollution, which could hurt fossil fuel producers.“If carbon risk is priced, this will add cost to the oil and gas industry,” said Betty Simkins, a report author and professor of finance at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. “But they need to be prepared for this.

A Secret Recording Reveals Oil Executives’ Private Views on Climate Change,"Last summer, oil and gas-industry groups were lobbying to overturn federal rules on leaks of natural gas, a major contributor to climate change. Their message: The companies had emissions under control.In private, the lobbyists were saying something very different.At a discussion convened last year by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a group that represents energy companies, participants worried that producers were intentionally flaring, or burning off, far too much natural gas, threatening the industry’s image, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times.“We’re just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,” said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, at the June 2019 gathering, held in Colorado Springs. “This pesky natural gas,” he said. “The value of it is very minimal,” particularly to companies drilling mainly for oil. A well can produce both oil and natural gas, but oil commands far higher prices. Flaring it is an inexpensive way of getting rid of the gas.

The audio was provided by an organization dedicated to tracking climate policy that said the recording had been made by an industry official who attended the meeting.Neither the organization nor the official was willing to be identified, out of concerns for industry retaliation, but three people heard in the recording, including the event’s moderator, Ryan Ullman of the Independent Petroleum Association, said that it reflected their comments. Jennifer Pett Marsteller, an association spokeswoman, confirmed the meeting’s date, location and speakers’ list, which matched the recording. She declined to comment on the speakers’ remarks, saying there was no official recording.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyA spokeswoman for Mr. Ness, Kristen Hamman, declined to confirm his remarks, saying that the Independent Petroleum Association had not produced an official transcript of the meeting that would allow her to do a comparison. Mr. Ness has publicly spoken against the need to strengthen regulation of methane, a major component in natural gas, calling stronger rules “an unnecessary burden” and saying the industry already produced “valuable energy resources in a responsible manner.”The remarks reflect the concerns of an industry that has presented itself as part of the solution to climate change, and natural gas as an important “bridge fuel” that can help the world shift away from coal, the dirtiest-burning energy source, toward renewable energy.Natural gas, when burned (whether in a flare, or to fuel a household oven), typically emits just half the planet-warming greenhouse gases that coal does. But by flaring off natural gas, rather than capturing it for use, companies are creating pollution without creating usable energy.Many companies do directly drill for and capture natural gas for use. But researchers have warned that drilling for the gas also causes sizable leaks of methane directly into the atmosphere, which is even more damaging for the climate than flaring the gas. Methane can also escape faulty flares, and companies sometimes also deliberately release the gas from wells and pipelines in a practice known as venting.Methane can trap more than 80 times more heat in the earth’s atmosphere than carbon dioxide, over the shorter term. Research has shown that methane emissions from oil and gas production are far larger than previously estimated.To address the issue, the Obama administration had proposed new regulations that would have required, among other measures, that oil and gas companies install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from their wells, pipelines and storage facilities.ImageRon Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said of natural gas: “The value of it is very minimal. But you’ve got to manage your gas to produce your oil.”Credit...Mike McCleary/The Bismarck Tribune, via Associated PressBut a coalition of oil and gas companies pushed the Trump administration to abandon those rules. It said the industry was already regulated by state laws and was already equipped to plug leaks on its own without federal rules. Lobbyists argued that the companies were already incentivized to rein in methane emissions, given that gas is a valuable resource.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The oil and natural gas industry has a pure economic incentive to prevent every molecule of ‘pollutant’ from escaping to the atmosphere,” wrote James D. Elliott, a lawyer representing a coalition of oil and gas groups led by the Independent Petroleum Association, including the North Dakota Petroleum Council, in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency on Nov. 25, 2019.But speaking a few months earlier, at the June 2019 meeting, Mr. Ness appeared to contradict that argument. There is such a glut of natural gas, he said, that some producers that drill primarily for oil have little use for the gas that comes up with it. Yet “you’ve got to manage your gas to produce your oil.”The pushback against more stringent methane rules has been led by smaller, independent producers who argued the rules were unfairly burdensome for smaller drillers, because they could not afford to invest in costly leak-detection and capture technology.Oil giants like BP, on the other hand, urged the federal government to keep methane regulations in place, saying it was “the right thing to do.”ImageRyan Flynn of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said that a chief concern among young, female and Latino voters, when it comes to the industry, “is always going to be environmental stewardship.”Credit...Susan Montoya Bryan/Associated PressBut ceding to the smaller operators’ demands, the Trump administration has proposed to eliminate federal methane rules in a move that would also reopen the question of whether the E.P.A. has the legal authority to regulate methane as a pollutant. The weakening of the methane standard is the latest in a long list of environmental-policy rollbacks under President Trump, who has vowed to loosen regulations on industry.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAt the Colorado meeting, executives also worried about a potential backlash against the industry, particularly among younger voters. Recent surveys have shown a sharp rise in the number of Americans who feel passionately about climate change, and the issue appears likely to play a more prominent role in this year’s presidential election than in previous ones. “Young voters, female voters, Hispanic voters, really every sector except for older conservative male voters,” Ryan Flynn of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said in the recording of the meeting, “their No. 1 issue when it comes to our industry is always going to be environmental stewardship, and concerns about what we’re doing with the environment.”Dan Haley, president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, laid out the stakes.“Hippies were going to change the world, until they wanted to get a job and buy a BMW,” Mr. Haley said in the meeting. “In Colorado, we’ve been kind of playing a game of whack-a-mole. We went from where fracking was the dirty word, and contaminated your water. And we inundated them with information about that and blitzed the TV airwaves,” he said. “Then slowly that changed into a health and safety messaging. And so we’re ramping up our health and safety messaging.”Climate change was “the prism through which everything is being viewed,” Mr. Haley added. “We have to be comfortable talking about it, talking about how we are part of the solution through natural gas. And again, hitting people with emotions hitting them where they’re where their heart is.”  Image“Hippies were going to change the world, until they wanted to get a job and buy a BMW,” said Dan Haley, president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association.Credit...David Zalubowski/Associated Press“The activists are doing this when they talk about banning fracking in Colorado. They don’t show explosions. They don’t show rigs. They show women and children,” he said. “We have got to begin playing at that same emotional level or we will not win these battles.”Scott Prestidge, a spokesman for Mr. Haley, said it was difficult to confirm the accuracy of a transcript from 2019, but said it was pretty clear that the remarks about the hippies were “said tongue-in-cheek.""AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyHe added: “In Colorado, the men and women of this industry live and work within the communities where oil and natural gas are being developed. They care about clean air, clean water, and in protecting their family’s safety and their community.”In an interview, Mr. Flynn said that he had merely been expressing what he described as widely held concerns about oil and gas’s effects on the environment that he thought the industry needed to better address.And he said attitudes toward regulations were changing, even among smaller oil and gas producers. For instance, during the Obama administration his organization opposed stronger federal methane regulations. However, it did not back the more recent efforts to repeal those rules.“We absolutely need to address young people’s, all people’s, concerns about climate change,” Mr. Flynn said. “We’ve taken criticism at times from our peers that we are engaging on these issues,” he said. “But it’s critical for the future of our industry.”Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

Big Business’s Undisclosed Climate Crisis Plans,"As the climate crisis intensifies, U.S. environmental policy has moved dangerously backward, with nearly 70 environmental rules reversed during this administration, and 30 more reversals in process. This intransigent, head-in-the-sand approach will not alter the reality of climate change, nor the risks and opportunities it presents the economy. The private sector understands this.Many large businesses and their investors, recognizing the urgency of the threat, are already attempting to protect their assets and investments from climate risks. As some continue to publicly question the science, they are shifting their capital to prepare for a future low-carbon economy. They know that a significant percentage of the U.S. equity market, as much as 93 percent by one estimate, is already exposed to harms from climate change, with this year’s intensified fire and hurricane seasons offering a devastating preview of more to come.Both investors and the broader public need clear information about how businesses are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, and how they are managing — or not managing — climate risks internally.Realistically, that can happen only through mandatory public disclosure. A recent report, “Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System,” by an advisory group to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, warned that “a world wracked by frequent and devastating shocks from climate change cannot sustain the fundamental conditions supporting our financial system.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe report emphasized that greater public disclosure of companies’ in-house risk calculations will be essential in helping governments (local and federal) as well as other businesses (large and small) measure and manage their climate risks.Financial regulators around the globe, from New Zealand to the European Union, are beginning to require that this information be made public. As the report notes, “existing legislation already provides U.S. financial regulators with wide-ranging and flexible authorities that could be used to start addressing financial climate-related risk now,” however, “these authorities and tools are not being fully utilized.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Indeed, some U.S. regulators have even blocked progress. That needs to change.A core purpose of the Securities and Exchange Commission, where I serve, is to develop and enforce disclosure requirements for public companies. rooted in the interests of investors and the public. Outdated thinking is stopping us from reducing climate risk through strengthening disclosure.One prominent outdated notion is that investments made on the basis of environmental, social and governance risks — known in the industry as E.S.G. — are merely about one’s policy preferences or moral choices. That might have been closer to reality over a decade ago, but as E.S.G. investing has grown and matured, so too has an understanding of its value.Today, lenders, credit rating agencies, analysts, stock exchanges and asset managers representing trillions in investments use E.S.G. as a significant driver in capital allocation, pricing and value assessments. A major study recently found that a large number of powerful institutional investors rank “climate risk disclosures” as being just as important in their decision-making processes as traditional financial statements and other metrics for an investment’s performance — like return on equity or earnings volatility.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyResearchers at the Bank of International Settlements have called climate change “a colossal and potentially irreversible risk of staggering complexity.” It is a systemic risks that will threaten global financial stability and spare no corner of the earth: Health, food security and water supplies across the globe will be disrupted.In the United States, we may experience the sort of climate-related migration that has begun elsewhere as Americans flee pockets of searing heat, seasonal fires, rising sea levels and flooding. Some of the worst-hit regions — the coasts, the West and the South — could experience damage totaling more than one-third of their economy, forcing the entire national economy to contract.Dealing with and adapting to the coming calamities means we must price climate risk accurately and drive investment toward an orderly, sustainable transition to green portfolios — rather than panicked scrambles and stock sell-offs as we see more and more climate disasters.The International Energy Agency estimates that globally it could take $3.5 trillion in energy sector investments alone every year through 2050 to reorient toward a climate-neutral economy. This pivot is not an ideological preference. It is an economic imperative. And it can effectively start only with accurate information.There is a misconception that securities laws already operate to produce enough climate risk information through existing broad requirements to disclose important or “material” information. If not, the argument goes, the S.E.C. will come after them.As a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer who spent over a decade spotting failed and misleading disclosures, I can attest that enforcement of broad-based materiality requirements does not work with this kind of near-magical efficiency.That’s why securities laws sometimes require very specific data and metrics on certain important matters like executive compensation. But, so far, not for climate risk. There are no specific requirements, and without that clarity how can companies be sure what is expected of them? As of now, there is little for us to enforce.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe voluntary disclosure that companies have increasingly provided in recent years is still largely regarded as insufficient. It’s not standardized, it’s not consistent, it’s not comparable, and it’s not reliable. Voluntary disclosure is not getting the job done.

The S.E.C. can act now.We can bring companies, investors and innovators to the table, and build on the work of organizations such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures to identify which specific climate risks and metrics should be disclosed and how.That’s the only way to get investors and the broader public the tools they need to protect their investments, instill corporate accountability and create a sustainable economy.Allison Herren Lee is a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

And it looks like that could happen again this year. According to the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, the six topics selected by the moderator for Tuesday evening, Chris Wallace of Fox News, will be: the candidates’ records, the Supreme Court, Covid-19, the economy, race and violence, and the integrity of the election.On Wednesday, a group of senators led by Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, called on the commission to ensure that moderators ask about climate change on Tuesday and in every debate after that.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“In 2020 alone, record-breaking wildfires have ravaged Western states, extreme heat waves have jeopardized our health and safety, water levels in the Great Lakes have continued to shift, and catastrophic hurricanes have destroyed homes and livelihoods,” the lawmakers wrote. “The climate crisis isn’t coming, it’s here.”“It is critical that every debate includes questions that ask the candidates what they would do to address climate change and environmental injustice,” they added, saying “Too much is at stake.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.The 37 lawmakers who signed the letter were all Democrats.Climate change routinely polled among the top three issues for Democrats throughout the primary, a fact that several activists and party strategists noted in criticizing the first debate topics on social media.You can read the full letter here.

Many ecosystems evolved to tolerate and even depend on fire, which occurred regularly because of lightning, Native American burning practices, and later, settlers.In the early 20th century, though, the U.S. government resolved to stamp out wildfires. And for a while, it succeeded, ushering the country through decades of anomalously fire-free, smoke-free summers.Now, that legacy of suppression has created a fire debt that must be paid back — with interest, because of climate change — either through controlled burns or out-of-control blazes.And that means learning to live with smoke again.“We’re going to have to accept that you are going to have seasonal smoke in the same way that you may have seasonal allergies,” said Stephen Pyne, an environmental historian and emeritus professor at Arizona State University.To learn what that might look like, check out our report from Portland, Ore., where my family’s been hunkered down inside for a good part of the past month.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyClimate disruption is here.

If there were such a thing as free market economics, of course our political parties could explain the crisis not just by lowering taxes, but by cutting the government bureaucracy and increasing transparency. It's likely that some of the proposals in the bill don't extend as far as we thought: they reduce the number of state and local governments that have to spend or will spend up to half their budgets. That we're not only offering some small-government deals that would slash spending on capital planning but offer even more than that is probably positive. But perhaps the best way to distinguish economic from political influence would be to eliminate the difference between the political policies they encourage and the social policies they ban.

"China, in Pointed Message to U.S., Tightens Its Climate Targets","President Xi Jinping of China pledged on Tuesday that his country would adopt much stronger climate targets and achieve what he called “carbon neutrality before 2060.” If realized, the pledges would be crucial in the global fight against climate change.The announcement, made at the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, is significant because China is currently the top producer of greenhouse gas emissions. What the country does to curb its emissions, therefore, is crucial to slowing down global warming on the whole.Todd Stern, the chief United States negotiator at talks for the 2015 Paris Agreement, called the carbon neutrality target “big and important news.”“The closer to 2050 the better,” Mr. Stern said.The timing of the announcement was equally notable, coming so close to United States elections in which climate change has become increasingly important to voters.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPresident Trump has pulled the United States out of an international agreement aimed at slowing down climate change.

In the past, China had said its peak emissions would come “around” 2030, after which its total emissions would begin to decline. China is on track to reach peak emissions within the next decade.Second, by saying China would aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, Mr. Xi left vague exactly when that key threshold would be reached. There is scientific consensus that the world must reach carbon neutrality, sometimes referred to as net-zero emissions, by 2050 in order to have a reasonable chance of averting the worst climate hazards.“This announcement therefore buys China some time,” Dr. Lewis said, “since the results of the U.S. presidential election are certainly one factor China is considering as it finalizes its climate plan.”China is the world’s largest consumer of coal, even as it dominates clean energy technology, producing more solar panels and wind turbines than any country in the world. It is also the world’s largest manufacturer of electric cars and buses. Whether and how China transitions away from fossil fuels to renewable energy could become clearer when it issues its next five-year economic plan, which will guide the country’s economic trajectory from 2021 through 2025.Climate change stands to affect the supply of food and water in China, while sea level rise threatens densely populated industrial cities along the country’s coast.

"At Climate Week, America’s Cascading Disasters Dominate","It’s been a very different Climate Week in New York City this year, and not just because of social distancing. The annual gathering, meant to showcase efforts against global warming worldwide, came as climate disasters pummeled the host country.There were fire tornadoes in the American West; a slow-moving hurricane drowned northwest Florida; children in Silicon Valley breathed a bit of the foul air that children in the shanties of Delhi grow up with.In other words, the year climate change took center stage as a problem that also affects the richest country in the world, not just low-lying islands of the Pacific and arid swaths of Africa.It was also a year of big promises.Two of the world’s three biggest economies, China and the European Union, pledged to act more quickly to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. And climate change became an issue in the United States presidential race.  When asked recently about the links between global warming and the fires racing across California, President Trump said, “I don’t think science knows,” even though scientists say the connection is inextricable.  The Democratic candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., responded by calling him a “climate arsonist.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyTitans of global business and finance, under pressure from shareholders, customers and employees, also pledged to do better, with company after company talking up their voluntary climate ambitions over the last few days during online events. Even so, the world as a whole is nowhere close to where it needs to be to avert the worst effects of a warming world, like more wildfires, fatal heat waves and the inundation of coastal cities.So, what needs to happen next? Here are three key takeaways.ImagePresident Xi Jinping of China addressed the United Nations General Assembly by video on Tuesday. Credit...Mary Altaffer/Associated PressThere’s a lot riding on the U.S. electionThe richest people in the world, because of what they consume, have produced a huge share of greenhouse-gas emissions, and in a very short period of time. Emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other gases, largely from the burning of fossil fuels, trap the sun’s heat, contributing to global warming.A recent analysis conducted by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute found that around half of all the planet-warming gases produced between 1990 (when the first United Nations climate report was published) and 2015 (when the Paris climate accord was reached) came from the world’s richest 10 percent. If you divvy up emissions by countries, nearly half, about 44 percent, of all emissions that have accumulated since 1990 come from the United States, the nations of Europe, and China. That’s why any chance of actually averting climate catastrophes depends largely on what these economies do.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn September came some signs of movement. Two of the three announced plans to make sharp cuts, though many details remain unknown.In mid-September, the European Union president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed more aggressive emissions cut by the 27-member bloc in the next decade. Her new target, which is yet to be approved by the European Parliament: trim emissions by 55 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The European Union has already committed, by law, to become carbon neutral by 2050, which means reducing carbon dioxide emissions and offsetting those that remain by figuring out how to offset their impact.A week later, President Xi Jinping of China announced in an address to the United Nations that his country, too, would speed up its climate plans, with a target to be carbon neutral before 2060.That leaves the United States. And it makes the results of the November elections crucial to global efforts to avert catastrophic climate change.Mr. Trump rejects climate science, has pulled the United States out of the Paris accord, an international agreement designed to slow down temperature rise and avert the worst climate impacts, and rolled back a series of environmental regulations. His challenger, Mr. Biden, has promised to bring the United States back into the Paris Agreement and proposed to invest $2 trillion to address climate change by, among other things, spurring the development of clean energy infrastructure.By the time the United Nations convenes a meeting on Dec. 12 for world leaders to update their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, the United States will be out of the accord or on its way back in.“Climate disruption is daily news,” the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said Thursday, “from devastating wildfires to record floods.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We must urgently reverse course,” he added.ImageA coal-fired power plant in Baotou, China.Credit...David Gray/ReutersCompanies must follow throughAt Climate Week, which started Monday and wraps up Sunday, a range of companies said they would reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions faster than they had pledged before. Walmart said it would aim to be carbon neutral without relying on offsets, like planting trees, which is how many companies plan to meet their climate targets.A dozen big companies that sell food joined an effort to get some of their suppliers to cut food waste in half, and gave themselves a decade to get there. Food waste, when it ends up in landfills, produces methane, a supercharged greenhouse gas.Some of the largest institutional investors joined together to push companies they invest in to disclose climate risks more fully.General Electric said it would stop building new coal-fired power plants, but it came at a time when the demand for new coal fired power plants is plummeting. The oil giant BP this month declared the end to the growth of oil demand. And Morgan Stanley, financial backer of many fossil fuel projects, announced this week it would aim to neutralize the emissions that result from its investments, but revealed few details.All of these commitments are voluntary. Whether they abide by their promisers remains to be seen.ImageProtesters at a rally against climate change in Bern, Switzerland, this week. Credit...Anthony Anex/EPA, via ShutterstockA chance to rewire the global economyThe coronavirus pandemic, having inflicted a million deaths so far, offered a chance to reset — both at the individual and collective level.

India has recently opened up its coal mining sector to foreign investors, with an eye to ramping up its coal production. Australia remains bullish on coal exports (partly to India).In the world’s 20 biggest economies, the Group of 20, as they’re known, coronavirus recovery packages doled out $212 billion to fossil fuels, and a far smaller share to renewable energy sources, according to an analysis by a consortium of research and advocacy groups.Another analysis, by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, concluded that only the European Union had committed to devote as much as 20 percent of its total stimulus spending to sustainability, compared to only 1 percent to 3 percent in coronavirus stimulus packages by the United States, China and India.Around this time last year, during Climate Week 2019, millions of young people thronged the streets of world capitals with a message for world leaders: “You had a future, and so should we,” they chanted.The coronavirus shuttered their street protests for months.

Climate Disruption Is Now Locked In. The Next Moves Will Be Crucial.,"America is now under siege by climate change in ways that scientists have warned about for years. But there is a second part to their admonition: Decades of growing crisis are already locked into the global ecosystem and cannot be reversed.This means the kinds of cascading disasters occurring today — drought in the West fueling historic wildfires that send smoke all the way to the East Coast, or parades of tropical storms lining up across the Atlantic to march destructively toward North America — are no longer features of some dystopian future. They are the here and now, worsening for the next generation and perhaps longer, depending on humanity’s willingness to take action.“I’ve been labeled an alarmist,” said Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist in Los Angeles, where he and millions of others have inhaled dangerously high levels of smoke for weeks. “And I think it’s a lot harder for people to say that I’m being alarmist now.”Last month, before the skies over San Francisco turned a surreal orange, Death Valley reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest temperature ever measured on the planet. Dozens of people have perished from the heat in Phoenix, which in July suffered its hottest month on record, only to surpass that milestone in August.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyConversations about climate change have broken into everyday life, to the top of the headlines and to center stage in the presidential campaign.

How California Became Ground Zero for Climate Disasters,"California is one of America’s marvels. By moving vast quantities of water and suppressing wildfires for decades, the state has transformed its arid and mountainous landscape into the richest, most populous and bounteous place in the nation.But now, those same feats have given California a new and unwelcome category of superlatives.This year is the state’s worst wildfire season on record. That follows its hottest August on record; a punishing drought that lasted from 2011 to last year; and one of its worst flood emergencies on record three years ago, when heavy rains caused the state’s highest dam to nearly fail, forcing more than 180,000 people to flee.The same manufactured landscapes that have enabled California’s tremendous growth, building the state into a $3 trillion economy that is home to one in 10 Americans, have also left it more exposed to climate shocks, experts say.And those shocks will only get worse.“There’s sort of this sense that we can bend the world to our will,” said Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist in San Francisco for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Climate change is exposing the vulnerabilities in the systems that we’ve engineered.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThose systems include some of the greatest accomplishments in American public infrastructure: Transporting huge amounts of water from the mountains to the coast and from north to south. Creating almost 1,500 reservoirs to store that water until it’s needed. Subduing the fires that are part of forest ecosystems, making more land livable for millions but stocking those forests with fuel in the process. Building dense cities along a shoreline susceptible to erosion and flooding.Those accomplishments reflect the optimism that defines California, according to R. Jisung Park, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, who focuses on climate adaptation. But like so much that underpins modern American life, they weren’t designed to accommodate the increasingly harsh extremes of climate change.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.“The shocks are outside the range, in many cases, of historical experience,” Dr. Park said. And in a heavily manufactured system, he added, the consequences of those shocks can become more dire.ImageFire retardant on a ridge at the Angeles National Forest near Monrovia, Calif., this month.Credit...David Mcnew/Getty ImagesImageSmoke shrouded Juniper Hills, northeast of Los Angeles, on Thursday. This year is California’s worst wildfire season on record.Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York TimesAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyImageA farmworker harvested grapes in the Central Valley during a heat wave last month.Credit...Brian L. Frank for The New York TimesDr. Park, like other experts interviewed, noted that California’s engineered landscapes are not the only factor behind its high-impact disasters. The state’s size and geographic diversity expose it to an unusually wide range of extreme climate events. And its large population means that when disasters do strike, they are very likely to affect large numbers of people.Still, the manufactured systems that support the state’s population and economy have left the state especially vulnerable. The wildfires are only the latest example of how climate change can cause engineered landscapes to go awry. Those blazes are partly the result of hotter temperatures and drier conditions, scientists say, which have made it easier for vegetation to ignite, causing fires to become bigger, more intense and more frightening.“Sometimes you feel really small and helpless,” said Mandy Beatty, who manages and maintains trails through the forests of the Sierra Nevada for the Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, a nonprofit group. On a chalkboard in her house in Plumas County, on the edge of the forests, she counts how long she and her husband have endured the smoke. Friday was Day 33. The fire, still raging, is on the other side of the mountain.The intensity of the fires also reflects decades of policy decisions that altered those forests, according to Robert Bonnie, who oversaw the United States Forest Service under President Barack Obama. And the cost of those decisions is now coming due.In an effort to protect homes and encourage new building, governments for decades focused on suppressing fires that occurred naturally, allowing the buildup of vegetation that would provide fuel for future blazes. Even after the drawbacks of that approach became clear, officials remained reluctant to reduce that vegetation through prescribed burns, wary of upsetting residents with smoke or starting a fire that might burn out of control.That approach made California’s forests more comfortable for the estimated 11 million people who now live in and around them. But it has also made them more susceptible to catastrophic fires. “We’ve sort of built up this fire debt,” Mr. Bonnie said. “People are going to have to tolerate smoke and risk.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPresident Trump, apparently referring to the increase in vegetation, has responded to California’s fires by telling the state to “clean your floors.” But most of the forests in California are federally owned, Mr. Bonnie noted, and Mr. Trump has sought to cut spending on forest management. And Mr. Bonnie said the fuels that matter most aren’t on the forest floor, but rather the trees themselves — and the best solution is letting more of them burn safely.Another example of California’s engineered landscape is the sprawling system of transporting and storing water. Three-quarters of the state’s precipitation falls north of Sacramento, according to Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. But three-quarters of the state’s water use is south of Sacramento.“The vast majority of our people are concentrated in the areas where the water is not,” Dr. Mount said. California’s response was to build what he called “by far the West’s most complicated storage and conveyance system.”That system moves water that falls as snow on the Sierra Nevada mountains to the south and west, providing drinking water for the state’s coastal cities and irrigation for farms in the arid Central Valley, turning California into an agricultural powerhouse that produces one-quarter of the nation’s food.Climate change is now shaking that system.ImageWater rushed out of the Oroville Dam in 2017 after part of the structure collapsed.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesImageSeal Beach, south of Los Angeles, in February 2019 after storms flushed garbage and debris into rivers and drains and out to sea.Credit...Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register, via Associated PressImageThe Folsom South Canal, part of the system of aqueducts that moves water in California.Credit...Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesPrecipitation patterns are becoming more extreme: The dry years are becoming drier, forcing cities and farmers to deplete their underground aquifers — something that Frances C. Moore, an assistant professor of environmental economics and climate science at the University of California, Davis, called a “race to the bottom.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“That is not something that’s a sustainable response,” Dr. Moore said.At the same time, wet periods are becoming wetter, which brings challenges of its own. Heavy rains threaten to overwhelm the vast network of aqueducts, reservoirs and dams that hold that water.That increases the likelihood of the sort of catastrophe that almost struck three years ago, Dr. Mount said. A combination of intense rain and structural damage nearly caused the failure of the Oroville Dam, the nation’s highest, which would have unleashed disastrous flooding north of Sacramento.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on? Get the latest news about climate change, plus tips on how you can help.Sign UpOroville is unlikely to be a one-off event. California has more dams rated “high hazard” than almost any other state, according to figures from the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. California’s state auditor reported in January that while the state has upgraded the Oroville Dam, others around California continue to pose a risk.“You’re got 40 million people who are dependent on this system, which was designed in the last century,” Dr. Mount said. “It’s not a surprise that you’re seeing many crises.”Climate change is also threatening California’s coastline, the longest in the nation after Alaska and Florida. That coastline is less physically exposed to rising seas than parts of the Atlantic, where water levels are rising more quickly, according to Dr. Dahl at the Union of Concerned Scientists.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut California’s more densely populated coast, combined with its use of landfill to expand waterfront communities and its famous cliff-side homes, mean the state has more people at jeopardy from rising seas.“We’ve built right to the edge of the water,” Dr. Dahl said. “We’ve altered the coastline to suit our needs, and we’re increasingly seeing the limitations of that.”ImageThe Dollaradio station in Pacifica last year.

I’m fifth-generation.”That optimism is shared, perhaps unsurprisingly, by state officials. Kate Gordon, a senior climate adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom, described a series of steps the state is taking to cope with climate risks, including shifting more development into cities and away from the edge of the wilderness, and designing coastal roads and bridges with rising seas in mind.“We’ve allowed for a development pattern that’s completely sprawled, which I don’t think we can keep doing,” Ms. Gordon said. “We have a lot of ability to be more compact, to be more efficient.”Others were more wary. Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley and co-director of the university’s Climate Impact Lab, described being stuck inside as smoke filled the sky, and walking around his home with a hand-held air-quality indicator to find out which rooms had the worst air. “Everyone who could leave town has left town,” he said.Climate change in California is more than just an escalating series of short- and long-term disasters, Dr. Hsiang said. It’s also eroding the idea that the state can mold itself into whatever it wants to be, insulated from the physical threats around it.“California was the land of opportunities,” Dr. Hsiang added. “There’s this story that we can have it all, and that’s just not true.”Thomas Fuller contributed reporting from Quincy, Calif.",nytimes,"How California Became Ground Zero for Climate Disasters,"" by Joe Romm, Ann Hazen, and Andrea Martinez, at The State University of New York Press, vol. 16, no. 3, 2000.[2] ""Who Was John F.

‘Kiss the Ground’ Review: Regenerating Hope for the Climate,"The actor Woody Harrelson narrates the documentary “Kiss the Ground,” a frenetic but ultimately persuasive and optimistic plan to counter the climate crisis. Streaming on Netflix, the film makes a case for the healing power of soil, arguing that its capacity to sequester carbon could be the key to reversing the effects of climate change.Directed by Joshua Tickell and Rebecca Harrell Tickell, whose credits include other socially conscious documentaries such as “The Big Fix” and “Pump,” “Kiss the Ground” takes a wide-ranging approach. The film begins by examining how tilling and the use of pesticides have led to soil erosion, and then traces the damage done to our ecology, health and climate. The filmmakers find a solution in regenerative farming, an ethical practice designed to restore degraded lands and facilitate carbon drawdown.Traveling around the world, the directors frequently employ juxtaposition to showcase the beauty of soil health. In North Dakota, a regenerative rancher stands at the boundary between his lush acreage and his neighbor’s denuded farmland; footage of the Loess Plateau in China before and after restorative methods reveals how dust bowls can become a Garden of Eden.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPedagogic sequences about science and agriculture are punctuated by short profiles of celebrities involved in climate activism, including Jason Mraz, Patricia Arquette, and Ian Somerhalder. They lend a friendly face to the fight for climate solutions, and like Harrelson as our narrator, their intermittent presence serves to ground the documentary as it zips from topic to topic.But the film’s arguments, which largely hold water, dry up when it comes to politics. Releasing “Kiss the Ground” weeks before an election seems pointed. Yet the Tickells are vague in their indictment of the United States, lamenting the country’s absence from climate initiatives without naming names.

The stalk would grow, the corncob would grow, but there would be hardly any kernels, so they couldn’t really eat it or sell it. When I went to Ramona Farms, an organic farm in the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, they went out to harvest organic blue corn. They opened up the corn husks and it looked exactly the same.

We were right up on the fireline at multiple fires, and it was raining ash. All over my cameras, all over me. It was very hot, and the thick smoke made it hard to breathe at times, and burned my eyes and throat. The fires can move quickly when the wind picks up, so you’re constantly having to be situationally aware and plan escape routes. I drove into Hurricane Laura at dawn, with a search-and-rescue caravan, a few hours after it made landfall. It was a difficult drive — pouring rain made it hard to see the road, and I had to dodge debris, as strong gusts of wind pushed my truck around on the highway. Power lines were down all over, blocking roads. There was no gasoline, electricity or running water.The hotel The New York Times had booked for me was destroyed, so I slept in my truck for days. My editor felt really bad about it, but after over a decade living and working in Venezuela I’m pretty used to challenging field conditions. “Oh my gosh, you had to sleep in your truck!” she said. “Are you kidding?” I responded, “I was in a Walmart parking lot!

The wide landscape fire shots, like the cover photo, were made at night, using a tripod and long camera exposure. I usually shoot everything hand-held, using natural light, so I was definitely out of my comfort zone photographing the fires.

"Heat and Drought Team Up More Frequently, With Disastrous Results","The combination of drought conditions and heat waves, which can make wildfires more likely, is becoming increasingly common in the American West, according to a new study. The results may be predictably disastrous.It has been well established that both droughts and heat waves have been occurring more frequently in recent decades. And while those conditions can cause damage singly, “their concurrence can be even more devastating,” the authors wrote.What used to be a rare weather double whammy has been occurring more frequently in recent decades because of climate change, said Mojtaba Sadegh, an assistant professor of civil engineering at Boise State University and an author of the new study, published Wednesday in Science Advances. “These events, dry-hot events, are intensifying,” he said. “This is rising at an alarming rate.”The new paper extends the historical weather record from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration back 122 years and examines heat and drought events that occurred across the contiguous United States.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe researchers found that the two phenomena feed each other in an intensifying cycle. They can also spread downwind, expanding drought and heat into broader areas like a storm front spreads rain, so “that self intensification will happen in a new region,” Dr. Sadegh said.While the researchers expected that the records they examined would show an increase in the combined events, “we didn’t expect to see the increase at this magnitude.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

That national tragedy was driven largely by lack of rainfall, which led to the air becoming hotter, and poor land management practices that caused astonishing dust storms, the scientists said. But recent dry-hot disasters are driven more by excess heat than a lack of rainfall.So the triggering mechanism for heat-drought events is shifting, according to the researchers, from lack of rain to excess heat. The authors conclude that “if meteorological droughts of the length and severity observed in the 1930s occur during the hot years that are increasingly common in recent decades due to global warming, their concurrence can have devastating impacts.”What’s more, they wrote, no major region of the continental United States is immune to severe droughts. They warn that the increased heat makes megadroughts more likely.Perhaps most chillingly, they cite research that warns that the heat from climate change will increase demand for water and lead to scarcity. That could put strains on national infrastructure and society that, the scientists wrote, “might push them to unprecedented states.”ImageA ranch in California’s Central Valley.

The most important finding of the new paper, he suggested, was the increasing importance of heat as the driver of droughts. The warming global temperatures, he said, “are making it easier to achieve historically rare levels of dryness.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDr. Swain recently noted in a series of comments posted on Twitter that California, and possibly the Pacific Northwest as a whole, are likely to see another severe heat wave in early October, which could “bring extreme wildfire burning conditions once again.”The new study, he said, does a good job of describing how drought and wildfire conditions spread and can occur over broad regions at the same time, making fire management much harder. “We are certainly seeing this with respect to wildfire in 2020,” he said.Dr. Sadegh noted that the nation has done little to address the changing conditions and continues to build new homes in wildfire-prone areas, yet “every year there is a new record,” he said. With 3.6 million acres burned this year in California alone, and five of the six biggest wildfires in the state’s history occurring in 2020, the answer, he said, is to address the issue of climate change squarely.“This is only getting worse,” he said, “until we act on it and reduce emissions.”",nytimes,"Heat and Drought Team Up More Frequently, With Disastrous Results on the Field.Basketball: A Brought-In Move The Right Way With The Need To Make Super-Faster, More Intelligent, Safer-Than-Most PerfectBasketball: Brought-In Changes What The Player Does.

Democratic Donors Push Biden for a Cabinet Free of Fossil Fuel Connections,"WASHINGTON — Liberal activists have opened a new front in their battle to push Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the left on climate change: a campaign to pressure the Democratic presidential nominee to reject advisers with any ties to fossil fuel companies.The targets include former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and others who served in the Obama administration.Last week more than 60 deep-pocketed donors asked Mr. Biden to commit to a moratorium on all new coal, oil and natural gas development — and to select advisers who are “free from fossil fuel influence.” The group, which includes Kathy Washienko, a clean-energy investor in Seattle; Robin Chase, a co-founder and former chief executive of Zipcar; and Adelaide Park Gomer, the president of the Park Foundation philanthropic group and a longtime anti-fracking activist, implored Mr. Biden to “choose new, bolder leadership” than those with whom he worked under President Barack Obama.“This incumbency of old ideas (like ‘all of the above’ energy policy) must end,” the donors wrote.The effort comes just days after Mr. Biden denounced President Trump as a “climate arsonist” and made the case that Americans suffering from wildfires, floods and hurricanes could not afford four more years of a climate-change denier in the White House. Even many of Mr. Biden’s persistent critics on the left described it as the most aggressive and detailed policy speech on climate change ever given by a presidential candidate.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe campaign held a phone bank on Thursday devoted to climate change, at which a campaign official, David Kieve, described Mr. Biden as having “the most progressive set of climate policies that anyone has ever run on in a general election before in history, period.”Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led group that has been skeptical of the former vice president, praised Mr. Biden’s address as “one of the best climate speeches that a Democratic presidential candidate has made.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.“He has moved a thousand yards on this in the last year and a half, and I believe it shows leadership,” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said in an interview.But tensions remain, particularly over Mr. Biden’s commitment to eliminating fossil fuels.Environmental groups have tried and failed to convince Mr. Biden to call for a nationwide ban on fracking. He has pledged a ban on new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters but assured union leaders in critical swing states like Pennsylvania that he will protect existing fracking jobs while pursuing a clean energy transition.At a CNN town hall on Thursday, Mr. Biden insisted that hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, or fracking, “has to continue because we need a transition” to renewable energy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The worry for those of us who want to see bolder action is that Biden isn’t going to be willing to move further,” said Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, a group that this month distributed a letter from 145 environmental organizations calling on Mr. Biden to bar fossil fuel executives, lobbyists and representatives from his campaign and administration.The list of those targeted includes Mr. Moniz, who in 2018 joined the board of Southern Company, an electric utility that sued the Obama administration over its Clean Power Plan climate change regulations. Another target: Mr. Salazar, Mr. Obama’s first interior secretary, who is now a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and in 2019 opposed a planned overhaul of oil and gas regulations in Colorado. In July, the campaign named Mr. Salazar a co-chairman of its Latino leadership committee.Lesser-known aides to Mr. Obama who have come into the groups’ cross hairs include Heather Zichal, an architect of the Clean Power Plan who served on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquefied natural gas company, and Jason Bordoff, a former senior director on the National Security Council who founded the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. The university, like many academic institutions, accepts funding from energy companies.“We can’t have people who are beholden to the fossil fuel industry in any way shape or form,” said Barbara Beseda Grasseschi, a Democratic fund-raiser in Sonoma County, Calif., who along with her husband, Tony Crabb, signed the Democratic donors’ letter.

Organizers shared the letter but not the full list of signatories.The Biden campaign declined to comment, but a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Courtney Parella, called Mr. Biden “an empty vessel filled by the radical left’s agenda.”John Holdren, Mr. Obama’s chief science adviser and a professor of environmental policy at Harvard University, said the effort was “misguided.” Mr. Holdren called Mr. Moniz “the best energy secretary in history,” noting he helped develop the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Most researchers, including himself, had accepted funding from energy companies, he said, and have pushed the private sector to tackle climate change.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign Up“We are not going to solve the climate problem over the dead bodies of the private sector,” Mr. Holdren said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Bordoff and Ms. Zichal declined to comment. In a statement, Mr. Salazar said of Mr. Biden, “As vice president, he helped spearhead the effort that unleashed the renewable energy revolution including permitting over 20,000 megawatts of renewable energy on public lands. In implementing the Biden climate change agenda, I am certain he will surround himself with the best people to implement that agenda.”Mr. Moniz said in a statement, “Everything must be on the table to meet the challenging but essential target of net-zero emissions by midcentury,” adding, “Building broad coalitions, bringing together labor, industry, policymakers and the environmental community, will be essential.”At the heart of the debate is averting the worst consequences of climate change and what role natural gas should continue to play.Scientists widely agree that net emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide must be zero by 2050. Mr. Biden has laid out a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to support clean energy, electric vehicles and energy-efficient homes. Emissions from the power sector would be eliminated by 2035.The Obama administration argued that natural gas, which produces about half the carbon emissions as coal but also emits methane, another greenhouse gas, is a necessary “bridge” to clean power. Its growth is a large reason U.S. emissions have declined over the past decade.Yet many energy experts agree that the United States no longer needs to build new natural gas plants to meet energy demands. Currently the United States meets just under 40 percent of its electricity demand through clean energy — a mixture of nuclear power and renewables like wind and solar. A recent report by GridLab, a private think tank, and the University of California at Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy found that the United States could reach 90 percent clean energy by 2035 without increasing customer bills from today’s levels.Leah C. Stokes, an energy policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said the final 10 percent would quite likely come from natural gas, playing “a somewhat marginal backup role in the system.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If you really want to limit warming, it’s not rocket science,” she said. “Stop building fossil fuel infrastructure.”Mr. Biden has cited climate change as one of “four historic crises” facing the country, along with the coronavirus, the economic downturn and racial injustice. Mr. Biden can use it to draw a sharp contrast with Mr. Trump, whose disregard for science links his approach to environmental policy with his handling of the pandemic.Mr. Biden has also taken care to frame combating climate change as an economic opportunity. At a virtual fund-raiser on Thursday whose hosts included Mr. Salazar, Mr. Biden said: “When Trump thinks of climate change, he can barely muster one word. He calls it a hoax. I think of one word, too: jobs.”As the fight over personnel heats up, climate experts also are pressing Mr. Biden to continue playing offense. Democratic strategists say that is likely to energize younger voters, who prioritize climate change, while also appealing to college-educated suburban voters put off by the president’s science denial.“Obviously the Republicans will attack Democrats for going too far,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, “but I would much rather be playing the hand of somebody who takes climate change seriously than playing the hand of somebody who describes it as a hoax.”Lisa Friedman reported from Washington, and Thomas Kaplan from Connecticut.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

This rise will have devastating impacts on global water supplies, as polar ice sheet extent continues to increase, or coastal populations become imperiled and coastal areas can no longer defend themselves from wildfires.

Trump’s Motto: Your Money or Your Life,"Whenever I talk about Covid-19 or climate change with skeptics, I use a simple analogy: Imagine that your child is sick with a disease and you decide to take her to 100 different doctors to get multiple opinions — and 99 doctors give you the same diagnosis and prescribed treatment and one tells you that there’s nothing to worry about, that your child’s disease will “disappear … like a miracle, it will disappear.”What parents in their right minds would follow the advice of the doctor with the one-out-of-100 diagnosis?This, alas, is no hypothetical. This, alas, is actually the most important question facing voters in choosing our next president. Are you ready to trust your own child’s and the country’s health to the guy who holds the one-out-of-100 view on both climate change and Covid-19? He being Dr. Donald Trump, founder of Trump University, where he apparently earned a B.S. in B.S.It is stunning to me how many conservatives want to go with the doctor with the one-out-of-100 diagnosis, since doing so is anything but conservative. It’s Trotskyite radical.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd to riff off Trotsky for another moment, Republicans may not be interested in Mother Nature, but Mother Nature is interested in them. Both climate change and Covid-19 have brutally elbowed their way into our lives in the past year, and for the same reason: We have been stressing our ecosystems to their limits and beyond.We’ve done this by invading wilderness areas and extracting wildlife carrying viruses never borne before by human beings and by emitting CO₂ that is heating the planet, amplifying storms that brought four months of rain in four hours in Florida and wildfires of epic proportions to the West Coast.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Joe Biden wants to proceed with more caution, and Trump wants to throw caution to the wind. That’s why the widely respected science journal Scientific American did something last week for the first time, declaring: “Scientific American has never endorsed a presidential candidate in our 175-year history — until now. The 2020 election is literally a matter of life and death. We urge you to vote for health, science and Joe Biden for President.”ImageJoe Biden sees past Trump’s false choices.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesThe choice could not be more stark or important. Trump’s implicit motto when it comes to Covid-19 and environmental protection is always the same: Your money OR your life?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhich do you value more? Biden’s motto has been your money AND your life — you should not, and do not, have to choose between them, if we are wise and follow science.How so? On Covid-19, for Trump, it’s jobs or masks, opening school or masks, social distancing or Big Ten football, science or church. Everything is black or white. And so is the result: So many Americans are jobless today and watching their kids learning remotely from home because Trump pitted masks against in-classroom schooling, masks against jobs, masks against indoor restaurant dining and masks against gathering for church services.And too many Americans chose jobs and school and church out of desperation, and they’ve already paid the price or will pay it.Biden, by contrast, is a unifier. He’s argued that if everyone wears a mask, practices social distancing and gets tested, we can BOTH protect many more jobs AND protect many more lives. Masks are not at war with jobs; they are the driver and protector of job growth in a pandemic. Masks are the vehicle to opening schools and other indoor activities — not their enemy. Just ask the Germans, Singaporeans or South Koreans.Ditto when it comes to the environment and climate change. Trump wants everyone to believe that protecting nature means unemploying people. It’s clean air OR economic growth. It’s gas guzzlers OR unemployment. He’s forever pitting jobs against nature.Biden stands for the unity of jobs AND the environment, the unity of jobs AND mitigating climate change. A clean, green economy equals better health AND more and better jobs. And the beauty is this: All that Biden has to do to prove his point is read aloud from the business and science pages:Oct. 15, New Scientist: “The green economy has grown so much in the U.S. that it employs around 10 times as many people as the fossil fuel industry — despite the past decade’s oil and gas boom.”June 30, Bloomberg.com: “Tesla Inc.’s market value has surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp.’s in a sign that investors are increasingly betting on a global energy transition away from fossil fuels.” Tesla makes electric cars, batteries and solar products.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAug. 25, CBS News: “Exxon Mobil, which joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1928, is being removed from the blue-chip stock market index. Its replacement: enterprise software company Salesforce.com.”April 6, Recharge: “Renewables accounted for nearly three-quarters of global power capacity additions last year — half of which was switched on in Asia, according to latest figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency.”Sept. 17, Fortune editor Alan Murray: “Lululemon C.E.O. Calvin McDonald told me yesterday his company now has more U.S. stores closed due to environmental risk — fires in the West, hurricane in the Gulf, etc. — than due to Covid-19.”If climate change turns out to be a less serious problem than predicted, and we pursue all of the above anyway, we will be like an athlete who trains for the Olympics, but the Olympics are postponed. No problem. We’ll just be that much healthier. Our air will be cleaner, our industries and vehicles and homes and industries will be so much more efficient and our economy will be the world leader in the clean power technologies that every country will want to import from us — climate change or not — as we add nearly a billion people to the planet by 2030. Yes, there will be nearly one billion more people on the planet in 10 years.On the other hand, if we treat climate change like a daydream and it proves to be a nightmare, we will be in real trouble as a species.So, I hope Biden goes into next week’s debate and just says: “My fellow Americans, you don’t hire an arsonist to put out forest fires. You don’t hire a divider to heal racial wounds. You don’t hire a poisoner to clean up your water supply. And most of all — most of all — you don’t hire someone who pits nature against jobs and jobs against health at a time when we so clearly need them all and we so clearly can have them all.”",nytimes,"Trump’s Motto: Your Money or Your Life‬ is important; Your health is important (please call before coming at us to make an appointment); Your money is important now or else it might lose your spot for awhile.‬Why can't the BTH call you out before you go outside?

A New York Clock That Told Time Now Tells the Time Remaining,"For more than 20 years, Metronome, which includes a 62-foot-wide 15-digit electronic clock that faces Union Square in Manhattan, has been one of the city’s most prominent and baffling public art projects.Its digital display once told the time in its own unique way, counting the hours, minutes and seconds (and fractions thereof) to and from midnight. But for years observers who did not understand how it worked suggested that it was measuring the acres of rainforest destroyed each year, tracking the world population or even that it had something to do with pi.On Saturday Metronome adopted a new ecologically sensitive mission. Now, instead of measuring 24-hour cycles, it is measuring what two artists, Gan Golan and Andrew Boyd, present as a critical window for action to prevent the effects of global warming from becoming irreversible.ImageFrom left, the artists Andrew Boyd and Gan Golan in Union Square in Manhattan.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York TimesOn Saturday at 3:20 p.m., messages including “The Earth has a deadline” began to appear on the display.

The creators say their aim is to arrange for the clock to be permanently displayed, there or elsewhere.Mr. Golan said he came up with the idea to publicly illustrate the urgency of combating climate change about two years ago, shortly after his daughter was born. He asked Mr. Boyd, an activist from the Lower East Side, to work with him on the project.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe artists said they had previously made a handheld climate clock for Greta Thunberg, the teenage activist from Sweden, before her appearance last year at the United Nations Climate Action Summit.Image The Climate Clock, in reflection.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York TimesTheir goal of creating a large-scale clock was influenced in part by the Doomsday Clock, maintained online by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and by the National Debt Clock near Bryant Park in Manhattan. Mr. Golan and Mr. Boyd decided that the Climate Clock would have the most impact if it were displayed in a conspicuous public space and presented like a statue or an artwork.“This is arguably the most important number in the world,” Mr. Boyd said. “And a monument is often how a society shows what’s important, what it elevates, what is at center stage.”Eventually, Mr. Golan and Mr. Boyd seized on “Metronome,” a mixed-media work by Andrew Ginzel and Kristin Jones that covers a 10-story-high area on the north wall of One Union Square South, a residential high rise.The work also includes concentric circles rendered in gold-flecked brick that ripple outward from a round opening. When it was unveiled in 1999, clouds of steam and musical tones issued from the facade.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOver the years the sound and steam have ceased. The numbers, however, kept moving.The original artists had been thinking about reimagining the work to address the deepening climate crisis when, in February, they got a letter from Mr. Golan and Mr. Boyd.“It was kind of magic,” Ms. Jones said, calling the timing “beautiful synchronicity.”ImageThe overall project, based on a 10-story-high mixed-media work by Andrew Ginzel and Kristin Jones.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times“The Climate Clock will remind the world every day just how perilously close we are to the brink,” Stephen Ross, chairman of Related Companies, the developer that owns One Union Square South, said in a statement.

It includes an explanation for the Climate Clock numbers, including a link to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body that assesses the science related to climate change.The report, issued in 2018, said global warming was likely to reach 1.5°C over preindustrial levels between 2030 and 2052 if it continues at the current rate. That level of warming is projected to increase damage to many ecosystems and cause an estimated $54 trillion in damage, the report said.The website also tracks the growing percentage of the world’s energy supplied from renewable sources.

E.P.A. to Promote Lead Testing Rule as Trump Tries to Burnish His Record,"WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to overhaul the way communities test their water for lead, a policy change that will be pitched ahead of Election Day as a major environmental achievement for a president not noted for his conservation record.But a draft of the final rule obtained by The New York Times shows the E.P.A. rejected top medical and scientific experts who urged the agency to require the replacement of the country’s six million to 10 million lead service lines, an expensive but effective way to avoid crises like the one still afflicting Flint, Mich.The measure is the first major update in nearly three decades to the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, a regulation aimed at protecting drinking water from lead, a potent neurotoxin that has been linked to developmental problems in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said there is no safe level of lead exposure for children, and the new rule requires for the first time testing for lead in all schools and day care centers.“The rule will better identify high levels of lead, improve the reliability of lead tap sampling results, strengthen corrosion control treatment requirements, expand consumer awareness and improve risk communication,” the draft from mid-July said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut rather than enact the sweeping changes that some health leaders say are necessary, the E.P.A. is opting for more modest improvements. Some experts and critics said the new rule actually weakens the current rule in significant ways, for instance, by more than doubling the amount of time utilities can have to replace water systems with serious levels of lead contamination.“What’s the point of making the change?” said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, whose state enacted the country’s toughest lead standard for drinking water in the wake of the Flint disaster. Michigan also has required water suppliers to replace all lead service lines on public and private property before January 1, 2041.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.“Originally, we were encouraged that the Trump administration said they wanted to update the rule,” Governor Whitmer said. But when told of the final rule, she called it “sorely disappointing.”James Hewitt, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said in a statement that it is “premature to draw any conclusions on a rule that is still undergoing interagency review.” He added that the Trump administration “is committed to finally acting to better protect our children’s health and holistically address lead in America’s water systems.”Andrew Wheeler, the administrator of the E.P.A., has described the rule in recent speeches as a core achievement of the agency under Mr. Trump, who often boasts of producing the “cleanest air” and the “cleanest water” even as he has dismantled nearly 70 environmental regulations and is pushing to roll back another 30.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The Obama-Biden administration claimed to have worked on it for eight years, with nothing to show,” Mr. Wheeler said of lead pipe regulations while speaking at the American Enterprise Institute last week. “They even had a wake-up call in Flint, Mich., in 2014 but still did nothing.”ImageAndrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, has described the new rule as a core achievement of the agency under Mr. Trump, Credit...Pool photo by Al DragoThe Lead and Copper Rule was enacted in 1991 to regulate the levels of lead in public water systems. The E.P.A. has said the updated version will identify the most at-risk communities and make sure that communities have in place plans to reduce elevated levels of lead.Schools and child care centers, for example, would be required to notify those who use their facilities of elevated lead levels within 24 hours of testing rather than the current 30 days. The rule also would require water utilities to conduct inventories of their lead service pipes and publicly report their locations.At a House hearing in February, Angela Licata, the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, was testifying on behalf of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, and said a mandate to replace all lead service lines was impractical. She praised the E.P.A. plan for avoiding “unattainable mandates.”

“Compliance with such a mandate would take decades, cost billions of dollars and would prevent water systems from allocating their limited budgets to other projects and initiatives that may deliver greater public health benefits,” she said.But beyond internal debates among state and local officials, the new lead rule is unlikely to burnish the president’s image, political strategists say. Mr. Trump’s environmental record has been a rallying cry for some voters because he has relentlessly pushed to dismantle measures to control air and water pollution while mocking and dismissing climate change.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn recent weeks, however, he has sought a remarkable rebranding, even describing himself as the most environmental president since Theodore Roosevelt. In Jupiter, Fla., this month, he endorsed a 10-year moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Southeast coast.  His administration is the one that proposed lifting the moratorium in the first place.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign UpCabinet members like Mr. Wheeler have sought to make the case that while the Obama administration focused on distant issues like climate change, Mr. Trump has actually zeroed in on environmental issues close to home, like the quality of the water coming from taps.During his speech in Florida, Mr. Trump said his administration was “strengthening standards to prevent vulnerable children from being exposed to lead and copper in drinking water, including in our schools,” adding, “They were exposed to lead and copper in drinking water. We’ve done some job with that, that was an important one.”Republican strategists said Mr. Trump’s campaign might be trying to improve his standing among suburban women and other swing voters. But they also doubted it would pay off.“Trump’s not going to lead on climate obviously, so they have to look at specific problems they can try to solve,” said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican Party. He said promoting things like the update to the Lead and Copper Rule was a good strategy for Mr. Trump — but only because the administration had “tied one hand behind its back” by refusing to even engage on climate change.Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster, conceded, “If you are an environmental voter in 2020, you are voting for Joe Biden.” The Trump administration’s efforts on lead in water “won’t change a single vote,” he continued, even among undecided voters.ImageA lead pipe removed last year from under a street in Newark.Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesTwo former E.P.A. officials described the new rule as insufficient. Ronnie Levin, a public health professor at Harvard University who spent 37 years at the E.P.A. pioneering lead protections in water, paint and gasoline, said the agency’s political leaders shut its scientific experts out of deliberations on the new measure.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMiguel Del Toral, who recently retired from the E.P.A. in Chicago, where he also worked for more than 30 years on lead, agreed.“They had their minds made up about what they wanted and didn’t want in the rule, and we kept banging our heads against the wall arguing science,” Mr. Del Toral said.Asked whether career E.P.A. scientists were shut out of the process, Mr. Hewitt, the agency spokesman, said, “Our career drinking water experts are a driving force behind our more protective rulemaking.”Erik D. Olson, the senior strategic director for health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, said the slower timetable for replacing lead pipes was “a huge weakening,” adding that “it will mean another generation of kids will be drinking lead-contaminated water.”Under the old rule, utilities had to replace some of their lead service lines if they repeatedly tested above the E.P.A.’s “action level” of 15 parts per billion. They were given about 14 years for the full replacement. The new rule will give them approximately 33 years to fully replace the service lines, Mr. Olson said. If utilities repeatedly test between 10 and 15 parts per billion, water systems will be required to confer with state authorities to develop “a goal rate” for replacing their lead lines, but the rule does not provide a deadline for doing so.Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Michigan pediatrician whose research exposed the Flint water crisis, called the new rule “heartbreaking.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We have really failed at a national level to learn the lessons of Flint,” she said. “A poison that has no safe level is in our drinking water.

Election and Supreme Court Fight Will Decide Trump’s Environmental Legacy,"[Update: President Trump has selected Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court.]WASHINGTON — President Trump has initiated the most aggressive environmental deregulation agenda in modern history, but as his first term drives to a close, many of his policies are being cut down by the courts — even by Republican-appointed jurists who the administration had hoped would be friendly.Those losses have actually heightened the stakes in the election and the fight over a replacement on the Supreme Court for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A second term, coupled with a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court, could save some of his biggest environmental rollbacks.Since January courts have dealt a series of blows to the Trump administration’s plans to ramp up fossil fuel development and undo decades of environmental protections. This month, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked implementation of a major rollback of methane emissions standards for the oil and gas industry while it considers permanent action. That followed decisions by judges that have thrown the future of the Dakota Access Pipeline into doubt, struck down the relaxation of protections for migratory birds and vacated the rollback of an Obama-era rule to reduce waste from natural gas flaring on federal lands.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFive recent unfavorable rulings came from Republican-appointed judges, including a 6-3 clean water decision in April by the Supreme Court with Justice Ginsburg in the majority. A panel of three judges appointed by President Trump unanimously overturned a policy that would have suspended hefty new penalties for automakers who failed to meet fuel efficiency standards.According to a database kept by New York University’s nonpartisan Institute for Policy Integrity, the Environmental Protection Agency has won only nine out of 47 cases in court under Mr. Trump, while the Interior Department has won four of 22. The Trump administration’s overall win rate hovers just under 16 percent, the group said, compared to win rates of about 70 percent for both the Obama and Bush administrations.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.But the courts have in most cases given the administration an opportunity to go back and revise their work. The future of those rules may then rest on whether Mr. Trump is re-elected, with a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court ready to hear his fresh attempts.“If there is a second Trump administration they may have time to go back and do it right,” said Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.Trump administration officials and supporters dispute the institute’s statistics and contend they have obtained mostly favorable outcomes. On Sept. 11, for example, the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia declined to block the Trump administration’s overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act from taking effect, pending an ultimate decision on the legality of the regulatory changes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut even conservative legal scholars said the mounting losses are impossible to ignore.“There is a sense that the administration has been in a hurry and has been sloppy,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.Courts have yet to rule on Mr. Trump’s biggest rollbacks of clean water rules, curbs to greenhouse gas emissions in automobiles and power plants, and environmental reviews of infrastructure projects. But activists and Democratic attorneys general expressed confidence that judges would find the unwinding of even those environmental protections illegal, despite the work that went into them.Early in the administration, a number of courts ruled that agencies acted illegally by providing little or no justification when they rewrote, weakened or repealed regulation.Now courts are increasingly telling the E.P.A. and Interior Department that their legal, scientific and economic analyses upholding rollbacks directly violate underlying laws.ImageThe Trump administration had sought to change the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to eliminate penalties for energy companies that kill birds “incidentally.”Credit...Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York TimesSome of the decisions have been scathing.“It is not only a sin to kill a mockingbird, it is also a crime. That has been the letter of the law for the past century. But if the Department of the Interior has its way, many mockingbirds and other migratory birds that delight people and support ecosystems throughout the country will be killed without legal consequence,” Judge Valerie Caproni of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in an August ruling that blocked the Trump administration’s relaxation of protections for migratory birds.In a statement, the Interior Department said it still intended to move forward with a final rule on the changes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn the case overturning the Trump administration’s relaxation of penalties for automakers, the three Republican judges found “no ambiguity” in the statute that Congress passed in 2015 ordering federal agencies to adjust a wide range of civil penalties to account for inflation.

And in August a panel of two judges appointed by Republicans and one appointed by a Democrat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the E.P.A.’s 2019 approval of an air pollution rule for Pennsylvania that would have allowed coal-fired power plants in that state to exceed pollution limits.The court typically gives the federal agency deference in decision-making, the judges wrote. But they said, “To receive such deference, the agency cannot reach whatever conclusion it likes and then defend it with vague allusions to its own expertise; instead, the agency must support its conclusion with demonstrable reasoning based on the facts in the record.”Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign UpThe E.P.A. contends it has been successful in the majority of its significant cases. In an opinion article for Bloomberg Law, the agency’s general counsel, Matthew Z. Leopold, pointed to cases like a federal court ruling in August that rejected a request from 17 states to block the Trump administration’s revisions to a rule that significantly narrows the definition of which bodies of water are federally regulated, and a 2019 federal appeals court ruling that upheld the E.P.A.’s decision not to finalize an Obama-era requirement that mining operators prove they can pay for cleanup in the event of a disaster.Jeffrey H. Wood, who served as acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s environment and natural resources division under Mr. Trump and is now a partner at the law firm Baker Botts, agreed: “The current record shows that D.O.J. and E.P.A. are making a solid defense of the Trump administration priorities.”Election 2020 ›Latest UpdatesUpdated Sept. 28, 2020, 2:36 p.m. ET1 hour ago1 hour agoA Biden campaign video shows how small Trump’s $750 tax bill is, compared with what average workers pay.End the filibuster?

The Trump administration doesn’t like to do its homework.”He argued Democratic attorneys general, who have been pounding the administration with lawsuits, have three things on their side: “The facts, the science and the law.”Mr. Gerrard said one notable trend in the administration’s losses was that courts are objecting to regulatory analyses that are supposed to back up policies but make no mention of the policies’ impact on climate change. In May, the United States District Court for the District of Montana vacated 287 oil and gas leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management in 2017 and 2018 because the agency had failed to examine the leases’ cumulative climate impacts.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySimilarly, a federal court ruling in July 2019 granted a preliminary injunction to conservation groups that challenged the renewal of grazing permits in Oregon because, the judges found, the Bureau of Land Management had failed to consider the effects of climate change.And, in 2018, a federal judge in Montana ordered the Trump administration and TransCanada to stop work on the Keystone XL pipeline, saying Mr. Trump’s approval of the project violated laws by ignoring facts about climate change.“The administration is so reluctant to mention climate change that they get in trouble for not even mentioning it,” Mr. Gerrard said.He and other regulatory experts noted that if Joseph R. Biden Jr. gets into the White House in January, he will have to provide a written explanation of the reasons he wants to roll back each Trump administration action. Eliminating Trump’s executive orders will be relatively easy, but going through the regulatory process all over again on issues like fuel efficiency standards will take time.That would make lawsuits brought by Democratic attorneys general all the more important because they will have kept many rules from going into effect while their replacements wind their way through the regulatory process.“A lot of these rollbacks are going to have very shallow roots, and perhaps no roots as all,” said David Hayes, executive director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.James E.

"After Fire and Floods, Glimmers of Hope","During the increasingly common ecological disasters that visit this country, there inevitably arises the hope that Americans and their elected politicians will learn from the experience, adopt new policies and provide for a less destructive future. We are now in such a period, with two unfolding climate-fueled disasters occurring at once: Savage wildfires in the West that have consumed more than five million acres of forests and scrublands and taken multiple lives in four states, and a Category 2 hurricane that has brought dangerous flooding and widespread damage to the Florida Panhandle.Once again, disaster has yielded glimmers of hope, or at least evidence of common sense. A recent Times article by Christopher Flavelle, a Washington-based climate reporter, notes that Americans by substantial margins support much stronger building codes and even outright bans on new construction in flood- and fire-prone zones. Eighty-four percent of people surveyed supported mandatory building codes in risky areas, and well over half supported outright bans. One interesting aspect of these findings — drawn from a joint survey by Stanford University, the environmental research group Resources for the Future and the survey company ReconMR — is that a majority of Republicans favored tougher rules. That’s surprising because Republicans tend to be much more skeptical about global warming than Democrats and, more to the point, much more hostile to government regulation.The survey, however, also highlights a depressing underside: While the public’s appreciation of the dangers of building in risky areas may be shifting, attitudes in state and local governments and the real estate industry have hardly budged. These are the entities that hold the cards when it comes to residential construction. For all sorts of reasons, not least the need for property tax revenues for schools and other purposes, local communities want to build, even when the environmental risks seem self-evident. According to the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, an advocacy group that works to strengthen homes from natural and man-made disasters, just one-third of local jurisdictions in the United States have adopted disaster-resistant building codes. Not surprisingly, the idea of flatly banning new homes outright in at-risk areas is anathema, even among climate-sensitive politicians. In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who has adopted several useful fire-prevention measures, seemed nearly offended when asked whether he would ban home building in at-risk areas.“There is something that is truly Californian about the wilderness and the wild and the pioneering spirit,” Mr. Newsom said. “I am not advocating for no.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut what of those ordinary folks who say they’ve been newly sensitized to the dangers of global warming? The truth is that many of them are a bit like Mr. Newsom, unwilling to accept boundaries when their own desires are at stake. New rules and new fire codes are OK, even a ban in some places. Just don’t ban us!In the West, for instance, one study found that from 1990 to 2015, 32 million homes were built in fire-prone areas near forests, powerful evidence that for many people the lure of living near the wild is greater than their best instincts about the risks of living in increasingly dry and fire-prone areas.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.So, too, is the eternal lure of the seashore. A 2019 study undertaken by Climate Central, a New Jersey environmental science group, showed that even after Hurricane Sandy, home construction in flood-prone areas in many coastal states continued at a brisk pace. This could change: The present confluence of fires and floods is truly scary. But so far there is not much evidence that the growing evidence of trouble now and trouble ahead is actually changing behavior.Where was the president as the West burned and the Gulf Coast drowned? As usual, in his own special cocoon of denial surrounded by “alternative facts.” In one of the more risible moments of his presidency, Donald Trump went to Florida earlier this month and, with an eye to the state’s electoral votes, declared his support for two worthy causes — Everglades restoration and a ban on oil drilling off Florida’s coasts. Whereupon he also anointed himself “the No. 1 environmental president since Teddy Roosevelt” — an appraisal that would come as a huge surprise to, among others, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, whose various environmental legacies, in particular Mr. Obama’s, Mr. Trump has spent the better part of four years trying to subvert.His true colors resurfaced when, a few days later, after weeks of silence on California’s agony, Mr. Trump added a side trip to Sacramento for a briefing on the fires. He showed almost no empathy for ordinary Californians and insisted, as he had before, that the crisis arose largely from the state’s mismanagement of its forests, the majority of which are in fact a federal responsibility. As for the long-accepted view that global warming is turbocharging floods and fires, he said the science of climate change was suspect and the scientists were confused.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyTo give Mr. Trump his due, it is quite true that the debris and dead trees that have accumulated over the years in forests in California and elsewhere provide massive amounts of fuel for especially destructive blazes. Unlike the president, who just points fingers, several prominent members of the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, have proposed legislation that would increase the Forest Service’s underfunded controlled burning program — that is, prescribed and carefully monitored fires — to clear out vegetation.Though tardy, a systematic sweep of the forests could be a useful byproduct of the fire. But it would be of even greater benefit for the issue of climate change to remain near the center of the national political conversation, where the floods and fires have pushed it. Joe Biden was so enraged by Mr. Trump’s cavalier attitude that he called the president a “climate arsonist.” An open letter from Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, the most learned of all senior Democrats on climate change, said it best: “There is no fire suppression plan on this planet that does anyone any good if it doesn’t even acknowledge the role of climate change.”For years, experts warned of the dangers of a pandemic.

"As Trump Again Rejects Science, Biden Calls Him a ‘Climate Arsonist’","[Follow our daily updates on the latest presidential election polls.]WASHINGTON — With wildfires raging across the West, climate change took center stage in the race for the White House on Monday as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called President Trump a “climate arsonist” while the president said that “I don’t think science knows” what is actually happening.A day of dueling appearances laid out the stark differences between the two candidates, an incumbent president who has long scorned climate change as a hoax and rolled back environmental regulations and a challenger who has called for an aggressive campaign to curb the greenhouse gases blamed for increasingly extreme weather.Mr. Trump flew to California after weeks of public silence about the flames that have forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, wiped out communities and forests, burned millions of acres, shrouded the region in smoke and left at least 27 people dead. But even when confronted by California’s governor and other state officials, the president insisted on attributing the crisis solely to poor forest management, not climate change.Mr. Biden, for his part, assailed Mr. Trump’s record on the climate, asserting that the president’s inaction and denial had fed destruction, citing not just the current emergency on the West Coast but flooding in the Midwest and hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. In an outdoor speech at a museum in Wilmington, Del., the Democratic presidential nominee sought to paint a second Trump term as a danger to the nation’s suburbs, flipping an attack on him by the president.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” Mr. Biden asked. “How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms? If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?”The politicking came as firefighting teams across the West Coast battled shifting winds and drier weather on Monday, sparking additional fire fronts that threatened to make new kindling out of forests and cover more of the country with hazardous smoke and falling ash. By Monday afternoon, haze had spread across much of the United States and could be seen over New York and Washington.Maps: Fires and Air Quality in California, Oregon and WashingtonWhere major fires are burning in the Western states and how unhealthy air quality has become.Heavy smoke kept some firefighting aircraft grounded as fire pushed into new areas, prompting fresh evacuations in Idaho, Oregon and California.In Oregon, with a confirmed death toll of 10 along with 22 others missing, Gov. Kate Brown said the state was getting firefighting support from as far as North Dakota and Michigan. She expressed gratitude for the national assistance, saying the state could use all the help it could get. “Without question, our state has been pushed to its limits,” Ms. Brown said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDoug Grafe, the chief of fire protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry, said crews had made progress containing fires. But he said rains anticipated to fall Monday were not materializing and winds threatened to exacerbate fire conditions in some areas. Mr. Grafe said the rains that may now come on Wednesday or Thursday could also include lightning, raising the danger of new fires.ImageFirefighters battling the Bobcat Fire in Santa Anita Canyon near Los Angeles on Sunday. Fires have burned millions of acres across the West and shrouded the region in smoke.Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York TimesMr. Trump, who had come under intense criticism for barely addressing the crisis before, interrupted a western campaign swing to make a two-hour visit to an airport in McClellan Park outside Sacramento, where Air Force One descended through a smoky haze. Not far away, one of the biggest fires, now largely contained, recently burned more than 363,000 acres.As soon as the president disembarked from the plane at Sacramento McClellan Airport, where the stench of smoke filled the air, he did not wait for his scheduled briefing to tell reporters that the cause of the conflagration was poor forest management, not climate change.“When trees fall down after a short period of time, they become very dry — really like a matchstick,” Mr. Trump said. “And they can explode. Also leaves. When you have dried leaves on the ground, it’s just fuel for the fires.”At his subsequent briefing, however, Gov. Gavin Newsom and his top environmental adviser pushed the president to acknowledge the role of climate change. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, made a point of doing so exceedingly politely, reaffirming his working relationship with the president, thanking him for federal help and agreeing that forest management needed to be improved.But Mr. Newsom noted that only 3 percent of land in California is under state control while 57 percent is federal forest land, meaning under the president’s management as governed by federal law.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“As you suggest, the working relationship I value,” Mr. Newsom said. But he said climate change clearly was a factor. “Something’s happening to the plumbing of the world, and we come from a perspective, humbly, where we submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident that climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this.”He went on: “And so I think there’s an area of at least commonality on vegetation, forest management. But please respect — and I know you do — the difference of opinion out here as it relates to this fundamental issue on the issue of climate change.”Mr. Trump did not argue the point. “Absolutely,” he said, and then turned the floor over to another briefer.But Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary for natural resources, pressed Mr. Trump more bluntly. “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” he told the president.This time, Mr. Trump rejected the premise. “It’ll start getting cooler,” he insisted. “You just watch.”“I wish science agreed with you,” Mr. Crowfoot replied.“Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Mr. Trump retorted, maintaining a tense grin.Other California officials who were not present rejected Mr. Trump’s view. Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento said it was a positive development that the president made the trip to demonstrate concern. “Showing up matters,” he said in an interview. “But more important is what you actually do. The country desperately needs national leadership around the climate emergency.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySome environmental specialists said that Mr. Trump had a point about forest management but that it should not be an excuse to deny climate science and refuse to take action.“Raking the leaves and forest floors is really inane. That doesn’t make sense at all,” said Ralph Propper, the president of the Environmental Council of Sacramento. “We’re seeing what was predicted, which is more extremes of weather.”Mr. Trump got some backing from hundreds of supporters who gathered outside the airport, some of them echoing his point about culling forests to prevent the kind of outbreak consuming the region. “I think they should have been cutting trees” ahead of fire season, said Rachel Moses, 43, of Roseville, Calif., who was wearing a pink Trump hat and brought her two sons with her.Experts say climate change, the management of public lands and decisions over where to site housing all contribute to wildfires. Mr. Trump has exclusively blamed poor forest management and last year issued an executive order directing agencies to cut down more trees, arguing that expanding timber harvesting would reduce forest fires.Image“If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. asked Monday at an outdoor speech in Wilmington, Del.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesMr. Biden, on the other hand, has proposed spending $2 trillion over four years to escalate the use of clean energy and ultimately phase out the burning of oil, gas and coal. He has pledged to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and eliminate carbon pollution from the power sector by 2035.In his speech at the Delaware Museum of Natural History, Mr. Biden accused Mr. Trump of making the country more vulnerable by denying climate change. He made a case for treating the reduction of fossil fuel emissions as a nonpartisan issue that could create manufacturing jobs while preserving the planet.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We have to act as a nation,” Mr. Biden said. “It shouldn’t be so bad that millions of Americans live in the shadow of an orange sky, and they’re left asking: ‘Is doomsday here?’”Mr. Biden also sought to tie Mr. Trump’s rejection of the scientific consensus on climate to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“I think this is a larger narrative that you’re just now starting to see emerge out of the Biden campaign,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “Climate change becomes Exhibit A in a much broader case he’s making about the fact that Donald Trump is out of touch with reality.”Whit Ayres, a Republican political consultant, said Mr. Trump was not helping himself politically by continuing to reject climate science. “It’s gotten to the point,” he said, “where denying the fundamental reality of climate change is no longer a credible position.”Peter Baker and Lisa Friedman reported from Washington, and Thomas Kaplan from Connecticut.

China’s Pledge to Be Carbon Neutral by 2060: What It Means,"Environmentalists have welcomed the pledge by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, to speed up reductions in emissions in the world’s top-polluting nation and reach carbon neutrality by 2060.The ambitious goal, which surprised many experts, could help significantly slow global warming. They warned, however, that Mr. Xi had offered almost no detail, raising doubts about the viability of targets that remain years in the future.Here’s what to know about the pledge:Xi’s pledge is a tectonic shift in policy, not yet practiceImageInstalling a wind mill in the Xinjiang region in 2014.Credit...Chinatopix, via Associated PressChina has long argued that as a developing economy it should not have to share the same burden of curbing emissions as developed nations whose pollution went unchecked for decades. China is now pledging to lead by example, setting itself goals befitting a country that aspires to be a superpower.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyUnder the Paris climate deal reached in 2015, China pledged that its emissions would peak around 2030. Mr. Xi promised on Tuesday to move up that timetable, though he did not provide specifics. The bigger surprise, analysts said, was Mr. Xi’s pledge to reach “carbon neutrality” — meaning China’s net carbon emissions will reach zero — by 2060.More than 60 other countries have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050, a consensus deadline that scientists believe must be met to have a reasonable chance of averting the worst climate catastrophe. Those countries are small compared to China, which now produces 28 percent of the world’s emissions.

In recent years, analysts have warned about worrisome trends in the country’s commitment to fight global warming in the face of economic slowdowns.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCoal consumption, which had declined from 2013 to 2017, driven in part by a push to improve China’s notorious air quality, began to rise again in recent years as the economy faced economic headwinds and the government sought to stimulate industrial growth.The rise was interrupted by the Covid-19 shutdown, but China’s economy is recovering more quickly than others. Research by Mr. Myllyvirta has shown that by May, carbon dioxide emissions from energy production, cement making and other industrial uses were 4 percent higher than the year before. China also granted more construction permits for coal-fired power plants in the first six months of 2020 than it had each year in 2018 and 2019.Mr. Xi, in laying out his country’s plans in a speech at the United Nations, did not detail how China would meet the targets. Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said that the lack of specificity was probably intended to leave the Communist Party leadership flexibility in the short term to pursue an economic rebound following the pandemic.The government’s next five-year plan, to be released soon, will be a key document, detailing the necessary economic, industrial and environmental changes that will be necessary.“They really need to roll up their sleeves from today to capture the level of ambition we heard last night in our daily practices,” Mr. Li said in a telephone interview from Beijing, referring to Mr. Xi’s U.N. speech.The impact could affect all 1.4 billion people in ChinaImageInstalling solar panels on a high-rise in Wuhan in 2018.Credit...Bryan Denton for The New York TimesMr. Li said the carbon neutrality pledge required a complete transformation of the Chinese economy.“Think about it: The way we eat, the way we consume energy, the way we produce our food, the way we commute to work will need to be completely rearranged,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhile China clings to industries that are consumers of coal, it has also emerged as a leader in clean energy technologies, including solar panels and wind turbines. It is the world’s largest manufacturer of electric cars and buses. That could leave the government well positioned to make a transition away from fossil fuels, provided the political commitment is there.China could also ramp up its ambitions to build nuclear power plants to replace coal-fired plants, though that would prompt other environmental and safety questions.Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, touted the growth of renewable energy, saying China’s capacity now accounted for 30 percent of the world’s total. Meeting the new goals “reflects China’s willingness to work with other countries to build a vigorous, clean and beautiful world and its responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind,” he said on Wednesday.Mr. Xi has previously pledged to increase government support for new technologies, while doing more to fight pollution, protect natural resources and expand the country’s national park networks.Preserving the Communist Party’s power remains his first priority, but pollution and other environmental threats are increasingly seen as threats to the party’s standing. That was evident in this summer’s devastating floods on the Yangtze River and its tributaries in central China.“Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature,” Mr. Xi said on Tuesday, addressing the General Assembly by video.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyChina has come under pressure to fight climate changeImageThe Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, addressing the United Nations by video link on Tuesday.Credit...Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMr. Xi’s China is generally impervious to criticisms of its domestic policies, but his government has faced pressure to do more on the warming climate. China’s commitments were raised last week when he met with leaders of the European Union, which had threatened to impose carbon tariffs if China did not reduce its emissions.The Europeans pressed China to reach peak emissions by 2025, as most European nations have vowed to do. While Mr. Xi stopped short of that, his pledges to move the target before 2030 and to set carbon neutrality as a goal for the first time stood in stark contrast to President Trump’s climate skepticism, which was punctuated by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement.Pledging to do more on the climate could at least counterbalance the rising anger China faces in Europe and beyond over its record of oppression in Xinjiang and Tibet, its territorial conflicts in the Himalayas and the South China Sea, military threats toward Taiwan and a sweeping crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy.“The Europeans will be closely watching how serious Xi is, but it was a very clever and well-timed move,” Janka Oertel, director of the Asia Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said.Claire Fu contributed research.",nytimes,"China’s Pledge to Be Carbon Neutral by 2060: What It Means for the Future of the Climate According to: (1) UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Policy (2020), a resolution endorsed by 27 Member States of the Conference of Parties, adopted in Geneva by 16 September 2014 (2) UN Climate Change Conference Report 2030 (2013), a report of the Committee on the Implementation of its second comprehensive climate negotiations on 2 October 2014, a report of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Policy (UNFCCC)(3) The two Global Alliance Declaration of Sustainable Development, signed by the ECHR (World Equestrian Federation) on 23 June 1975 (the EEA (Eligible Species Agenda) since 1980), have ended their binding commitments to sustainability in accordance with the UNFCCC.

A Climate Center on Governors Island? Could Be a Game Changer,"Rumors of New York’s demise are exaggerated. The other day more than 160 business leaders wrote Mayor Bill de Blasio about “widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality-of-life issues.” The city is in many ways back to life.But City Hall had been running low on leadership and good ideas before the pandemic. New York needs them both now.So it was, in a sense, good news that the nonprofit Trust for Governors Island released a proposal on Monday to rezone disused parts of the island, long set aside for economic redevelopment.It’s an aspirational plan, more than anything. The goal, which has been circulating for a while, is to incubate a new climate research center. Similar ideas have been advanced for decades on Governors Island. There was once talk about a global health center. In 2002, City University of New York was rumored to be contemplating a campus. The governor and mayor talked about renaming the place CUNY Island.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThis time there’s not even a specific tenant in mind, just a desire to attract one. Still, change starts somewhere. The current rezoning proposal begins a city land use review process starting next month.ImageDisused warehouses from the derelict Coast Guard base on Governors Island. Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesI’ve seen renderings by WXY, the excellent New York architecture firm. They’re rosy advertisements for hypothetical construction. But they give a sense of the scale and potential of the concept, which in this case could entail as much as four or five million square feet of new development.According to Clare Newman, the president and chief executive officer of the trust, the prospective climate center would offer public programs, offices for green tech companies and architecture and engineering firms, and be anchored by a university or research institute that would build and pay for its part of the campus.In recent years, Governors Island has become one of the city’s quiet marvels. For several summers, my younger son has attended a kind of “Lord of the Flies” day camp there that’s basically a junk yard with hammers, nails and hands-off instructors. Eight minutes by ferry from Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, the island feels a world apart, a mini 19th century New England village with Adirondack chairs and food carts, smack in the middle of New York Harbor.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Lenape called it Pagganck, or Nut Island. The Continental Army used it to defend against a British naval assault; the Union Army, to imprison captured Confederate officers. Until 1996 it was a Coast Guard base, with barracks, a Burger King and bowling alley. By the time the city and state jointly acquired it from federal authorities (for $1) it was a ghost town, derelict and lacking potable water. The city took sole possession in 2010, with the goal of creating open space, cultural and educational programs and mixed-use development.Leslie Koch, the first president of the trust, oversaw the transformation. Last year nearly a million people from every ZIP code in the city visited. A maritime-themed high school has its home on the island. West 8, the Dutch landscape architecture firm, put together a master plan, which determined where development could go, and converted swaths of open space into spectacular parkland with rolling hills and meadows.The city has invested some $400 million so far. Like Brooklyn Bridge Park and other Bloomberg-era public-private ventures, the understanding has always been that Governors Island should eventually pay for itself. According to Ms. Newman, it still depends on the city to cover about three-fourths of a $20 million annual operating budget. With tax revenues cratering, who knows how long that will last.Of course many universities are also facing a cash crunch because of the pandemic. Not many may be looking to expand at this moment.But history can be useful here. Rockefeller Center broke ground at the start of the Depression; Lincoln Center, when thousands of New Yorkers were fleeing to the suburbs. The obvious precedent to the Governors Island proposal, the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, was hatched during the last recession.ImageYankee Pier now.Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesImageA rendering of what Yankee Pier might look like in the new development.Credit...WXY architecture + urban design/bloomimagesAnd, after all, it was in the wake of 9/11, when doomsayers predicted the end of tall buildings and the abandonment of New York by big businesses, that city leaders plotted an economic turnaround, which precipitated an unprecedented boom in skyscraper construction.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNow the West is ablaze. A Washington Post story this week describes two glaciers in Antarctica whose imminent collapse could raise global sea levels 10 feet. Covid-19, and America’s feeble response to it, dominate the headlines — but what has the pandemic proved if not that apocalyptic threats, man-made or otherwise, require preparedness, coordination, public education and fresh thinking?There’s a clear climate risk to building a climate research center on the waterfront. The trust counters that the island is, in fact, an ideal petri dish and laboratory for climate adaptation. It’s an argument. Part of the ingenuity of West 8’s design was to strategize protections that worked during Hurricane Sandy.Alicia Glen, a former deputy mayor, who now chairs the Governors Island Trust, cites the hopeful case of Robert Moses. Three-quarters of a century ago he helped persuade the United Nations to locate its headquarters in the city. That coup ensured New York would be at the center of the conversation about humanity and survival in the postwar era. It also brought economic development to the city.These days any new development is a call to the barricades for many New Yorkers. Those who love Governors Island as it is now may well ask whether even a do-good project is really necessary. A better question might be: Will whatever gets built there — if anything does — live up to the design standards of the changes so far?In terms of remaining obstacles, the “elephant in the room,” as Ms. Newman, the trust president acknowledged, is transportation. Access to Governors Island is still by irregular ferries. Proposals to extend the No. 1 train line, install a cable car, even build out Lower Manhattan, have all surfaced over the years.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIncreased ferry service to beefed up piers seems the easiest solution. It would require yet another capital outlay by the city.To judge from West 8’s master plan and WXY’s renderings, the good news is that existing parkland can be integrated with mostly low-rise development to preserve open spaces, repurpose historic buildings and turn the island into a kind of green Epcot, with a campus that could serve as both a research hub and a showcase for the latest resilient technologies and materials.Architecturally speaking, everything will come down to the details — and the as-yet-undetermined tenant(s).Meanwhile, here’s hoping the rezoning passes city muster. Planning the future of New York is what we need now. It involves many steps. This is a small but useful one. We need more.",nytimes,"A Climate Center on Governors Island? Could Be a Game Changer on Campus?FDA has been at work on regulations to reverse climate change and put an end to greenhouse gas emissions across the country over the past few decades. But there is more to the issue than regulation at the state and federal levels.To begin with, the federal government will have about $200 million of taxes on ethanol production after 2016. If states have to provide a percentage of an ethanol tax, they won't be able to charge lower gasoline and diesel prices as needed in 2015, since the state will have to cover many of the costs of raising state gas and diesel prices. So, that will ultimately mean that prices and taxes will be raised anyway during that time as well.FDA will still ask states to pay more, but the numbers will probably be pretty good. State governments — including Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi — will have to cut their fuel or fill their tanks, which was a significant impact of their $33 million federal program.It would also help explain why the FCC canceled its upcoming decision to require states to fund transportation, a key component of the program.

California Plans to Ban Sales of New Gas-Powered Cars in 15 Years,"California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars statewide by 2035, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday, in a sweeping move aimed at accelerating the state’s efforts to combat global warming amid a deadly and record-breaking wildfire season.In an executive order, Governor Newsom directed California’s regulators to develop a plan that would require automakers to sell steadily more zero-emissions passenger vehicles in the state, such as battery-powered or hydrogen-powered cars and pickup trucks, until they make up 100 percent of new auto sales in just 15 years.The plan would also set a goal for all heavy-duty trucks on the road in California to be zero emissions by 2045 where possible. And the order directs the state’s transportation agencies to look for near-term actions to reduce Californian’s reliance on driving by, for example, expanding access to mass transit and biking.“This is the next big global industry,” Governor Newsom said at a news conference on Wednesday, referring to clean-energy technologies such as electric vehicles. “And California wants to dominate it.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCalifornia has long cast itself as a global leader on climate-change policy, having already passed a law to get 100 percent of its electricity from wind, solar and other sources that don’t produce carbon dioxide by 2045.

Last year, only 8 percent of the nearly two million passenger vehicles sold statewide were battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Transportation remains California’s largest source of planet-warming emissions, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the state’s greenhouse gases from human activity.“We have a strategy to be as bold as the problem is big, to recognize that we have agency,” Governor Newsom said at the news conference, where he stood before a glittering half circle of electric cars. “We’re not just victims of fate.”In addition to setting new standards for automakers in the state, California will also likely need to increase financial incentives for people to afford electric vehicles and significantly expand its charging infrastructure, said Don Anair, deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It’s feasible, but it’s going to take California pulling all the levers at its disposal,” Mr. Anair said.The order would affect only new-vehicle sales, the governor’s office said. It would not prevent Californians from owning cars with internal combustion engines past 2035 or selling them on the used-vehicle market.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents most of the nation’s automakers, said it welcomed efforts to expand the electric-vehicle market in California, but questioned whether a ban on internal combustion engines was the best way to achieve that goal.“Neither mandates nor bans build successful markets,” said John Bozzella, the alliance’s chief executive, in a statement. “Much more needs to be done to increase consumer demand for Zero Emission Vehicles in order for California to reach its goals. It will require increased infrastructure, incentives, fleet requirements, building codes, and much more.”The new executive order would build on California’s existing vehicle policies. State regulators have already set a goal of putting five million zero-emissions vehicles on the road by 2030. In June, the state adopted a major rule requiring more than half of all trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035. And regulators are currently working on a rule that could require ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber to shift to electric vehicles.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

Although 15 countries have already announced plans to phase out sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines in the coming decades — including Britain, Denmark and Norway — California would be the first jurisdiction in the United States to do so.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEnvironmental groups had mixed reactions to Governor Newsom’s announcement. While they applauded the new goal for zero-emission vehicles, they noted that California remained one of the country’s largest oil and gas producers, particularly as energy companies have used hydraulic fracturing to unlock new fossil-fuel reserves in recent years.“Setting a timeline to eliminate petroleum vehicles is a big step, but Newsom’s announcement provided rhetoric rather than real action on the other critical half of the climate problem — California’s dirty oil production,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.“Newsom can’t claim climate leadership while handing out permits to oil companies to drill and frack,” Ms. Siegel said.In his news conference, Governor Newsom said he lacked the authority to ban oil and gas drilling in the state on his own. His executive order sets a goal of ending new permits for hydraulic fracturing by 2024, and he said he would work with California’s legislature to set rules that would better protect vulnerable communities from nearby fossil-fuel extraction and help the state’s energy industry transition away from oil and gas.“None of us are naïve. California is a fossil fuel state,” he said. “We need to focus on a just transition.”The oil and gas industry reacted sharply to the order.“Let’s be clear: Today’s announcement to curb in-state production of energy will put thousands of workers in the Central Valley, Los Angeles basin, and Central Coast on the state’s overloaded unemployment program, drive up energy costs when consumers can least afford it, and hurt California’s fight to lower global greenhouse gas emissions,” said Rock Zierman, chief executive of the California Independent Petroleum Association.Asked why he was moving forward with the electric car mandate by executive order rather than asking the legislature to approve it, Governor Newsom cited the example of the state’s new rule requiring all trucks sold in California to be zero-emissions by 2045, which was rolled out by the state’s clean air regulator, the California Air Resources Board.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“This moment demands leadership, it demands movement,” Governor Newsom said, adding that the truck rule is now being replicated in other states.In theory, a future California governor could try to undo Mr. Newsom’s rules, though legal experts said it would be difficult. “Executive orders can always be undone by future governors,” said Cara Horowitz, co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at U.C.L.A. Law School. “But once this reaches the regulatory stage, it’s a lot stickier.”There is one key complication in California’s move: The Trump administration has challenged the state’s authority to set its own pollution standards for cars and trucks as part of its rollback of Obama-era vehicle efficiency rules.

The Arctic Is Shifting to a New Climate Because of Global Warming,"The effects of global warming in the Arctic are so severe that the region is shifting to a different climate, one characterized less by ice and snow and more by open water and rain, scientists said Monday.Already, they said, sea ice in the Arctic has declined so much that even an extremely cold year would not result in as much ice as was typical decades ago. Two other characteristics of the region’s climate, seasonal air temperatures and the number of days of rain instead of snow, are shifting in the same way, the researchers said.The Arctic is among the parts of the world most influenced by climate change, with sharply rising temperatures, thawing permafrost and other effects in addition to shrinking sea ice. The study, by Laura Landrum and Marika M. Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is an effort to put what is occurring in the region in context.“Everybody knows the Arctic is changing,” said Dr. Landrum, a climate scientist and the lead author of the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “We really wanted to quantify if this is a new climate.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn other words, she said, “has the Arctic changed so much and so fast that the new climate cannot be predicted from the recent past?”Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

This year is expected to be a record or near-record low for ice extent, which will be determined by the end of this month as the summer melt period ends.For fall and winter air temperatures and rain vs. snow days, the simulations found that the transition to a new climate is occurring more slowly, with the shift expected to be complete by the middle of the century.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOverall, Dr. Landrum said, “We are beginning to get to the point where we can no longer know what to expect.”ImageKivalina, Alaska, on the Chukchi Sea, in September 2019. It is one of many Native villages threatened by eroding coastlines.Credit...Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesJennifer Kay, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado who was not involved in the research, said the new study builds on previous ones that had looked at fewer climate elements.“It’s nice to see all those variables discussed,” Dr. Kay said. And determining the timing of the various shifts is an interesting contribution.But scientists have known for a long time that fundamental changes were occurring in the region. “We know what used to be,” Dr. Kay said. “We call it the ‘new Arctic’ because it’s not the same.”Dr. Landrum said that Arctic communities are already suffering from the changes. Eroding coastlines are forcing some Alaska Native villages to consider relocating. Other changes are affecting the food supply. Warmer storms that bring rain on existing snow, for example, can lead to starvation of the animals Indigenous groups rely on.“Arctic climate change is not in the future for them,” she said. “It’s now.”Dr. Landrum said the climate models used in the study simulated the future in a world where planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases remained high. That provides some fodder for optimism, she said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We still have an opportunity to change how rapidly the Arctic evolves,” she said, “if we end up changing our emissions.”“You can’t just give up. If you work hard and make some changes there’s a possibility you’d have some dramatic effects.”Another study released Monday suggested that two Antarctic glaciers that have long been of concern to scientists over their potential to contribute to sea level rise may be in worse shape than previously thought.The Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers are rivers of ice, slowly moving ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in the continent’s interior to the ocean, where it melts and adds to sea level rise. In recent decades the two glaciers’ movement has accelerated, leading to more ice loss from the interior, largely because of melting by warm water underneath the glaciers.Even with the acceleration, however, complete melting of this part of the West Antarctic sheet could take centuries.The new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed satellite imagery and found cracks and other signs of stress damage to the glaciers’ ice shelves, the leading edges that float on the water. This evidence of damage, the paper’s authors wrote, is the first sign of structural weakening of the ice shelves, a process that can end in the shelves’ disintegration and even faster glacial flow of ice to the ocean. The authors said that incorporating these damage processes into models of ice-sheet dynamics is critical for more accurate assessments of potential sea-level rise.",nytimes,"The Arctic Is Shifting to a New Climate Because of Global Warming"".The global mean temperature between 1970 and 2011 dropped by about 1.5°C (5.3°F) compared to over the same period.

Fire Lessons From Australia’s South Coast,"The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email.By this time last year, I had already written my first bush fire story of the season — with a headline that called the destruction of the Binna Burra Lodge an omen of the future.Now, watching another round of unprecedented blazes destroy the American West, I’m reminded of all the interviews I did with scientists who have been telling the public for decades that climate change will make the worst fires hotter, bigger and more frequent.They were right. They are still right. And the consequences, like clouds of smoke, reach further and linger longer than most of us would have imagined.That’s one of the things I took away from a recent trip to the South Coast for a story about preparations for another fire season. What I found was that — in an area where you can’t drive more than a few minutes without seeing blackened trees — any thoughts of the future are being colored by the recent past.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMentions of last year’s fires came up in almost every conversation I overheard in cafes. Recovery, healing, kindness, prevention and paranoia all burst into view as the urge to take control of something, anything, has led to a surge of preventive burning, chopped down trees and never-ending calls to tell fire officials about potential hazards.Are neighbors burning too much? Too little?

"Arctic Sea Ice Reaches a Low, Just Missing Record","A “crazy year” in the Arctic has resulted in the second-lowest extent of sea ice in the region, scientists said Monday.Researchers with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said the minimum was most likely reached on Sept. 15, with 1.44 million square miles of ocean covered in ice. Since then, with temperatures falling and new ice forming, coverage has been increasing.Since satellite measurements of sea ice began four decades ago, only 2012 has had a lower minimum, when 1.32 million square miles were measured. The 2020 minimum was nearly a million square miles less than the average annual minimum between 1981 and 2010.This year also continues an alarming streak: The 14 lowest ice years have occurred in the past 14 years.

A Trump-Biden Split Screen on Climate,"[Follow our live coverage of the 2020 election between President Trump and Joe Biden.]As Trump continues to deny climate science, Biden says such remarks fit a pattern: “We’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America.” It’s Tuesday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.ImageWhere things standEven as he bore witness firsthand to the devastation caused by wildfires during a visit to California yesterday, President Trump continued to defiantly ignore the science of climate change.Speaking to reporters, he blamed local officials for failing to contain the blazes, and for not clearing fallen leaves from forests. “When trees fall down after a short period of time, they become very dry — really like a matchstick,” Trump told reporters at the Sacramento airport. “And they can explode. Also leaves. When you have dried leaves on the ground, it’s just fuel for the fires.”When asked about the role of climate change, he was dismissive at first. He passed the question on to Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who said he did believe the scientific consensus. (He also reminded Trump that 57 percent of land in California is made up of federal forests, which are technically under the president’s control.)But later, Trump did not hold back, saying explicitly that he continued to disbelieve the established science on global warming. “It will start getting cooler,” he said. “Just watch. I don’t think science knows, actually.” That statement was in line with Trump’s long history of public comments and official policies calling into question the legitimacy of climate science.Joe Biden gave a speech in Delaware yesterday bashing the president as a “climate arsonist,” while directly appealing to suburban voters. “If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” he asked. “How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms?”That language reflected an apparent bet from Biden’s team that suburban voters will be turned off by the president’s hostility to science — particularly in the midst of a pandemic during which Trump has often been at odds with his own health and science advisers.Eighty-four percent of suburbanites said in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll last month that they generally trusted public health experts to provide accurate information on the coronavirus, considerably more than people living in other areas. And just 23 percent of suburbanites said they trusted Trump’s statements on the virus, the poll found — the lowest of any geographic group.Biden ultimately tied together the coronavirus and the wildfires with the economy and the unrest in American cities. He used all of these issues to illustrate an argument that seemed almost lifted from Trump’s playbook: Under the current president, Biden argued, Americans are simply not safe.“He fails to protect us from the pandemic, from an economic free fall, from racial unrest, from the ravages of climate change,” Biden said. “It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America.”The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled yesterday that Howie Hawkins, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, will not appear on the general election ballot. The 4-to-3 decision clears the way for state election officials to proceed as planned with mail voting, which is set to begin in days. The state plans to send out more mail ballots than in any previous election.If the court had ruled in favor of Hawkins — whose legal effort was aided by a conservative law firm, with Republicans eager to see him siphon votes away from Biden in November — officials would have had to reprint thousands of ballots and send them out again.The court said that Hawkins and his running mate, Angela Walker, had waited too long to appeal a decision from the Wisconsin Elections Commission denying them ballot access because of a discrepancy in Walker’s address on their petitions.In Ohio, those who vote absentee will have to pay their own postage, after a Republican state panel denied the secretary of state’s request for up to $3 million to prepay for stamps. More than a million voters have filed applications for absentee ballots in Ohio so far.“Today was another missed opportunity by the legislature to make a small change, without an impact on our state budget, that would yield a big improvement,” said Frank LaRose, the secretary of state, a Republican.The mayors of 10 U.S. cities published an open letter yesterday calling on Trump to condemn the right-wing vigilantes who have violently clashed with protesters against racial injustice this summer.“We’ve seen an alarming number of fellow elected officials, including yourself, applauding armed intimidation of peaceful protesters,” the letter reads. “We are calling for an end to this dangerous rhetoric. Instead of inciting vigilantism, we urge you to join us in condemning reckless escalations by militias and other extremists.”All of the signatories are members of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an arm of Michael Bloomberg’s gun-control group, Everytown for Gun Safety.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPhoto of the dayImageCredit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesJoe Biden spoke yesterday outside the Delaware Museum of Natural History in Wilmington.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Is Nevada in play?

The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is flush with money, and has bought ads in both the Las Vegas and Reno markets.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign UpAs Jennifer Medina reports in an article out today, Nevada’s Democratic machine has established a strong track record over the past dozen years, winning most statewide elections through hard-fought campaigns that have centered on door-knocking and face-to-face contact — particularly with Black and Hispanic voters.But amid the pandemic, that kind of campaigning is harder to do, and Democrats have less than half the number of canvassers on the ground in Nevada than they did in September 2016. Some Democratic officials worry that Trump could flip the state red on the strength of white voters in rural areas.Indeed, the Times/Siena poll showed that Trump’s message might be resonating with those voters in particular. The president led Biden by 11 points among white likely voters in Nevada, a better showing than with white voters in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Minnesota — the three other swing states surveyed in that poll. By nearly two to one, white voters in Nevada said they considered addressing law and order to be a more pressing electoral issue than confronting the coronavirus crisis.Another sign of danger for Biden: his vulnerability with Hispanic voters, who are crucial to any Democratic victory there. Biden won just 17 percent of Latino support in the Nevada caucuses, with 50 percent caucusing for Senator Bernie Sanders, according to entrance polls. Nationwide, recent polls have generally shown Biden lagging behind Clinton’s level of Hispanic support in 2016.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNew York Times EventsThe evolving electorate: The Gen Z and millennial voteCan young voters get excited about the election if they aren’t excited about the candidates?

"In Visiting a Charred California, Trump Confronts a Scientific Reality He Denies","WASHINGTON — When President Trump flies to California on Monday to assess the state’s raging forest fires, he will come face to face with the grim consequences of a reality he has stubbornly refused to accept: the devastating effects of a warming planet.To the global scientific community, the acres of scorched earth and ash-filled skies across the American West are the tragic, but predictable, result of accelerating climate change. Nearly two years ago, federal government scientists concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels could triple the frequency of severe fires across the Western states.But the president has used his time in the nation’s highest office to aggressively promote the burning of fossil fuels, chiefly by rolling back or weakening every major federal policy intended to combat dangerous emissions. At the same time, Mr. Trump and his senior environmental officials have regularly mocked, denied or minimized the established science of human-caused climate change.Now, as he battles for a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump has doubled down on his anti-climate agenda as a way of appealing to his core supporters. At a rally in Pennsylvania last month, he blamed California’s failure to “clean your floors” of leaves, threatening to “make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe lethal fires spreading across the West — like the coronavirus that has ravaged the country for months — are a warning for the president that many voters may hold him and his administration accountable for brushing aside scientific experts and failing to effectively mobilize the government to minimize natural disasters that have claimed lives, damaged property and threatened economic prosperity.“Talk to a firefighter if you think that climate change isn’t real,” Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles, a supporter of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It seems like this administration are the last vestiges of the Flat Earth Society of this generation.”Mr. Trump’s climate record is far more aggressive than the laissez-faire environmental policy promoted for years by business interests in his party. Indeed, as he has sought to zealously roll back regulations, even some of the world’s largest oil companies and automakers have opposed the moves, saying that they will lead to years of legal uncertainty that could actually harm their bottom lines.“As an historic figure, he is one of the most culpable men in America contributing to the suffering and death that is now occurring through climate-related tragedy,” Jerry Brown, the former California governor who made climate change his signature issue, said in an interview on Sunday, though he was careful not to blame Mr. Trump specifically for the fires ravaging his state.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe president’s record is also more consequential, experts say, because the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere has now passed the point at which scientists say it would be possible to avert many of the worst effects of global warming — even if tough emissions policies are later enacted.Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign is hoping to use Mr. Trump’s climate positions as a cudgel against him with independents and moderate Republicans. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican former governor of New Jersey, is backing Mr. Biden’s candidacy in large part because of the president’s environmental policies.“It’s mind-boggling, the ignorance that he displays on this subject,” Ms. Whitman said in an interview on Sunday. “He doesn’t understand climate change. He doesn’t particularly believe in science. It’s all about him and his re-election.”“He doesn’t govern for all Americans,” she said.On Saturday, Mr. Trump abruptly added the trip to McClellan Park, Calif., near Sacramento, to be briefed on the fires to an already scheduled West Coast fund-raising and campaign swing. He had come under intense criticism for weeks of silence on the increasingly deadly blazes that are consuming parts of California, Oregon and Washington — three Democratic-led states that he has feuded with for years.White House officials noted that Mr. Trump had signed an executive order in 2018 to minimize the risk of wildfires and urged California and other states to improve forest management.“Other countries around the world are obsessed with the Paris climate accord, which shackles economies and has done nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and those on the radical left are pushing the Green New Deal, which would outlaw cows, cars and planes,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. He said Mr. Trump had put in place “common sense policies that have kept our air, water and environment clean.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut the president has often treated climate change and the environment as a deeply partisan issue, not unlike his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent racial upheaval in some cities, in which he has frequently lashed out at Democratic officials while praising the actions of Republicans.ImageHelicopters dropping water above Santa Anita Canyon in Arcadia, Calif., while battling the Bobcat Fire on Sunday.Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York TimesIn Florida last week, Mr. Trump extended a ban on offshore oil drilling supported by the Republican governor in a key election-year state, even though he has refused to do the same for Democratic-led states in the Northeast.At the event in front of supporters in Jupiter, Fla., Mr. Trump declared himself “a great environmentalist.”In fact, Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the science of climate change since long before he ran for president. In 2012, he tweeted: “In the 1920’s people were worried about global cooling — it never happened. Now it’s global warming. Give me a break!” He also tweeted that the concept of climate change “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”The president has continued to take a dim view of climate science throughout his tenure, even as the government he oversees has reinforced the accepted threats to the future of the planet.In 2017 and 2018, the federal government published a sweeping, two-volume scientific report, the National Climate Assessment, that represents the most authoritative and comprehensive conclusions to date about the causes and effects of climate change in the United States.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe report is clear about the causes — burning fossil fuels — and the effects: It found that the increased drought, flooding, storms and worsening wildfires caused by the warming planet could shrink the American economy by up to 10 percent by the end of the century.Two days before the White House published the 2018 volume of that report, Mr. Trump mockingly tweeted, “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS — Whatever happened to Global Warming?”In an interview a month before, he said of global warming, “I don’t know that it’s man-made,” and suggested that even as the planet warmed, “it will change back again” — an idea scientists have long debunked.Mr. Trump has also stocked his administration with senior officials who have openly questioned the basic science of climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which conducts scientific research on climate change, this year hired as a deputy assistant secretary David Legates, a scientist at the University of Delaware who has questioned human-caused global warming. The hiring of Mr. Legates was first reported by NPR.William Happer, a former senior White House adviser and a Princeton physicist who had gained notoriety in the scientific community for statements that carbon dioxide was beneficial to humanity, began an effort last year to ensure that the next National Climate Assessment did not include worst-case scenarios. Although Mr. Happer left the White House last year, that effort is continuing, according to three people familiar with the matter.And Mr. Trump’s first appointee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, declared early in his tenure that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, a statement starkly at odds with the scientific consensus.“It’s interesting to draw the parallels between Covid and climate change,” said Philip B. Duffy, the president of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who served on the National Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed the National Climate Assessment. “In both of those cases, Trump personally has refused to recognize the threat.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“In both cases, there is no plan to deal with crisis,” he added.Moreover, Mr. Trump has steadily dismantled the climate change plan that was already in place by effectively gutting the federal government’s authority to do anything to lower greenhouse gas pollution.“We had at the end of the Obama administration the first-ever federalwide regulatory regime on climate,” said David G. Victor, the director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego. “Most of that, the Trump administration has actively rolled back.”In his first months in office, Mr. Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which nearly every country in the world had pledged to reduce emissions of planet-warming pollution.Domestically, Mr. Trump directed Andrew Wheeler, the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to dismantle a suite of major climate change regulations put in place by the Obama administration, which had been designed to target pollution from the nation’s three largest sources of greenhouse emissions: coal-fired power plants, auto tailpipes and oil and gas drilling sites. Taken together, those rules represented the country’s first significant step toward reducing greenhouse gases, while putting the world’s largest economy at the forefront of the global effort to fight climate change.Now they are in shambles.In August, the E.P.A. completed the legal process of rolling back rules on methane, a powerful climate-warming gas emitted from leaks and flares in oil and gas wells. In April, it completed its rollback of the rules on tailpipe greenhouse pollution. And in June 2019, it replaced the Obama-era rule requiring coal plants to reduce emissions with a new rule devised to allow the plants to continue to release far more pollution.If Mr. Biden is elected, he has vowed to rejoin the Paris agreement and reinstate those rules, while pushing to enact even stronger policies, spending up to $2 trillion to promote the development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.But experts said it may take far more than that to rebuild the American climate change legacy — or its ability to persuade other governments to take similar action. That is a profound consequence, the experts said, because climate change is a global problem and cannot be meaningfully mitigated unless the world’s largest polluters all work in concert.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The really big effect of what Trump has done is to send a message to the rest of the world that the United States is not credible on climate change,” said Mr. Victor of the University of California, San Diego. “The rest of the world is not going to know if we’re serious because we keep swinging back and forth.”“Over the past 50 years, the effectiveness in creating international deals came from U.S. leadership,” he added. “And now nobody knows if we’re going to do that anymore.”Adam Nagourney contributed reporting from Los Angeles.",nytimes,"In Visiting a Charred California, Trump Confronts a Scientific Reality He Denies on CampusLast month, Trump once again branded climate change a hoax perpetrated on a California State University, Berkeley campus, in an interview with CNN. He claimed that California's massive oil and gas industry is getting the job done, so there's little doubt that oil and gas production has accelerated over the last three decades as climate change forces scientists to dig deeper into a fundamental climate change.If an oil and gas industry was getting those jobs, then, of course, all of this would be confirmed. This was the same Trump who said he was now confident climate change is on the rise because of the Obama Administration's ""man-made"" science. His campaign made no mention of whether Obama's EPA goals would meet the climate change science mandated by the Paris Agreement.

A New Front in the Biden-Trump Battle for the Suburbs: Wildfires,"LOS ANGELES — The explosion of wildfires across the West has opened a new battleground in the critical competition for suburban voters between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., with growing evidence that climate change is an acute concern for many Americans, particularly women, viewing the nightly images of destruction and thick blankets of acrid air.Mr. Trump has sought to combat his sharp decline among suburban voters by asserting that Democratic control of the White House would be a threat to the safety of the suburbs, raising the specter of crime, rioting and an “invasion” of low-income housing that many view as seeking to stoke racist fears.But Mr. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, is seeking to redefine what “safety” means for an electorate swept by fear amid a pandemic, social unrest in the streets and now deadly wildfires. He is casting climate change as a more real and immediate threat to the suburbs than the violence portrayed in Mr. Trump’s ads and public remarks, seizing in a speech on Monday on the devastating fires ripping through forests, destroying homes and taking lives.“It’s particularly tangible for people right now,” said Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Biden’s speech came as Mr. Trump paid a last-minute trip to California to meet with officials struggling with the catastrophe, and disputed their assertion that there was any connection between the fires sweeping the state and climate change.The developments suggest that an issue that has always been on the sidelines in national presidential campaigns — and had seemed eclipsed this time by the pandemic and social unrest — may be coming to the forefront with only seven weeks until Election Day.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.For at least some suburban voters, particularly those who live in the West, the threat of losing their homes to fire or the health risks to their families of skies clouded with smoke seem more immediate than the social unrest spotlighted by Mr. Trump in his speeches and advertisements.“We’re not seeing changes in crime,” said Representative Katie Porter of California, a Democrat who represents a once solidly Republican district in Orange County. “People are trying to stay home, trying to stay safe.”More broadly, the fires in the West — and Mr. Trump’s “it’ll start getting cooler, you just watch” disparagement of climate science during his visit to California — have reinforced the perception of the president as anti-science, particularly after his open skepticism toward experts advising him to act more aggressively against the Covid-19 pandemic.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Those fires in the West are obviously blue states and most of the country is not experiencing it,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “But it is a reminder for a lot of people — especially for these better educated suburban voters who he thought would react to law and order — of how he is against science.”ImagePresident Trump paid a last-minute trip to California to meet with officials struggling with the catastrophe.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesRob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist critical of Mr. Trump, said the swing suburban voters who delivered Democrats the House of Representatives in 2018 were “repulsed by the way the president talks about climate” specifically and science generally.“I don’t think these suburban voters are going to become climate change voters in 2020,” Mr. Stutzman said, “but the discussion around all of this highlights this Trump Neanderthalism that is offensive to them.”The importance of the battle was underscored again on Tuesday as Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, returned to assess the damage to her home state, meeting with Gov. Gavin Newsom near Fresno and examining the rubble of a home and a school playground destroyed in the Creek Fire.The wildfires have helped to illustrate a critical difference between the Trump White House and a potential Biden presidency. And Mr. Biden signaled what is emerging as a pivotal competition — to define the biggest looming threats to the nation, and particularly to people living in the suburbs — as the candidates approach three debates.“Donald Trump warns that integration is threatening our suburbs. That’s ridiculous,” Mr. Biden said on Monday. “But you know what’s actually threatening our suburbs? Wildfires are burning the suburbs in the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coasts.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn an election in which the gender gap was already a severe problem for the president — with polls showing women supporting Mr. Biden in far greater numbers than men — a renewed focus on climate could prove politically problematic for Mr. Trump’s efforts to win over a voting bloc he memorably has labeled “the ‘suburban housewife.’”“Women are much more concerned than men,” said Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. “The one holdout group in American not concerned about climate change are conservative white men.”In a survey earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found Republican women were more supportive of addressing climate change than their male counterparts. For instance, 47 percent of Republican women said the government was doing too little to protect air quality, compared with only 32 percent of Republican men. There were similar splits on addressing water quality, emissions restrictions on power plants and tougher fuel-efficiency standards.“To the extent there is a swing vote in this election, it’s a lot of Republican-leaning women, many of whom are in the suburbs,” said John D. Podesta, a top adviser to former President Barack Obama on climate change who also served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. “And this is an issue they care about.”Another Pew poll released last month showed 69 percent of people in the suburbs said climate change would be at least somewhat important in determining their 2020 vote, with 41 percent calling it very important.ImageJoseph R. Biden Jr. focused on the dramatic images of fires ripping through forests and destroying homes in a speech on Monday.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesThe fires and the hazardous air they have produced have so far been concentrated in Democratic parts of the nation, and, with the exception of Arizona, are not highlighted on the campaign battleground maps in the Biden and Trump headquarters.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut Mr. Biden’s advisers, as well as environmentalists who have watched in frustration for years as their issues were relegated to the back of a drawer, believe that the sheer destruction of the fires has further elevated this into a powerful issue.That is especially true in a season of hurricanes, dramatic temperature fluctuations and wild weather in other parts of the country. As the fires raged, the Gulf Coast was preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Sally and the torrential rains and flooding it would bring.Mr. Biden has notably framed climate change as one of four simultaneous crises facing the nation, along with the pandemic, the economic downturn and the reckoning over race and policing.“For the first time, the average American is likely to see climate change as a here, now, us problem,” said Mr. Maibach, who studies public opinion on the environment.“They saw it as a distant problem,” Mr. Maibach said of voters previously. “Distant in time — maybe 2100 but not today. Distant in space — maybe Bangladesh and not Boston. And distant in species — polar bears, for sure, but not people.”The climate change debate reflects what has been another critical difference between these two candidates: The value they placed on science-based data. Once again, as with the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Trump is denying the assertions of scientists as he seeks to minimize a threat to the nation’s well-being.That emphasis could face a backlash among suburban voters: 84 percent of suburbanites said in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll last month that they trusted public health experts to provide accurate information on the coronavirus, considerably more than people living in other areas. And just 23 percent of suburbanites said they trusted Mr. Trump’s statements on the virus, the lowest of any geographic group.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMs. Porter, who is one of the freshman suburban Democrats elected in 2018, said that she had seen a huge change in the political environment since Mr. Trump was elected president.“You now need to explicitly address climate change,” she said. “And this is an important change from like four years ago.”Mr. Podesta argued that while Mr. Trump has sought to turn climate change into a “culture war issue of the elite versus regular people” — by linking Mr. Biden to aggressive policy proposals like the Green New Deal — that has backfired in the face of the raging wildfires.“Guess what,"" Mr. Podesta said, “the regular people are fleeing for their lives in Oregon.”Adam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles and Shane Goldmacher from New York.

Democratic Donors Push Biden for a Cabinet Free of Fossil Fuel Connections,"WASHINGTON — Liberal activists have opened a new front in their battle to push Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the left on climate change: a campaign to pressure the Democratic presidential nominee to reject advisers with any ties to fossil fuel companies.The targets include former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and others who served in the Obama administration.Last week more than 60 deep-pocketed donors asked Mr. Biden to commit to a moratorium on all new coal, oil and natural gas development — and to select advisers who are “free from fossil fuel influence.” The group, which includes Kathy Washienko, a clean-energy investor in Seattle; Robin Chase, a co-founder and former chief executive of Zipcar; and Adelaide Park Gomer, the president of the Park Foundation philanthropic group and a longtime anti-fracking activist, implored Mr. Biden to “choose new, bolder leadership” than those with whom he worked under President Barack Obama.“This incumbency of old ideas (like ‘all of the above’ energy policy) must end,” the donors wrote.The effort comes just days after Mr. Biden denounced President Trump as a “climate arsonist” and made the case that Americans suffering from wildfires, floods and hurricanes could not afford four more years of a climate-change denier in the White House. Even many of Mr. Biden’s persistent critics on the left described it as the most aggressive and detailed policy speech on climate change ever given by a presidential candidate.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe campaign held a phone bank on Thursday devoted to climate change, at which a campaign official, David Kieve, described Mr. Biden as having “the most progressive set of climate policies that anyone has ever run on in a general election before in history, period.”Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led group that has been skeptical of the former vice president, praised Mr. Biden’s address as “one of the best climate speeches that a Democratic presidential candidate has made.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.“He has moved a thousand yards on this in the last year and a half, and I believe it shows leadership,” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said in an interview.But tensions remain, particularly over Mr. Biden’s commitment to eliminating fossil fuels.Environmental groups have tried and failed to convince Mr. Biden to call for a nationwide ban on fracking. He has pledged a ban on new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters but assured union leaders in critical swing states like Pennsylvania that he will protect existing fracking jobs while pursuing a clean energy transition.At a CNN town hall on Thursday, Mr. Biden insisted that hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, or fracking, “has to continue because we need a transition” to renewable energy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The worry for those of us who want to see bolder action is that Biden isn’t going to be willing to move further,” said Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, a group that this month distributed a letter from 145 environmental organizations calling on Mr. Biden to bar fossil fuel executives, lobbyists and representatives from his campaign and administration.The list of those targeted includes Mr. Moniz, who in 2018 joined the board of Southern Company, an electric utility that sued the Obama administration over its Clean Power Plan climate change regulations. Another target: Mr. Salazar, Mr. Obama’s first interior secretary, who is now a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and in 2019 opposed a planned overhaul of oil and gas regulations in Colorado. In July, the campaign named Mr. Salazar a co-chairman of its Latino leadership committee.Lesser-known aides to Mr. Obama who have come into the groups’ cross hairs include Heather Zichal, an architect of the Clean Power Plan who served on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquefied natural gas company, and Jason Bordoff, a former senior director on the National Security Council who founded the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. The university, like many academic institutions, accepts funding from energy companies.“We can’t have people who are beholden to the fossil fuel industry in any way shape or form,” said Barbara Beseda Grasseschi, a Democratic fund-raiser in Sonoma County, Calif., who along with her husband, Tony Crabb, signed the Democratic donors’ letter.

Organizers shared the letter but not the full list of signatories.The Biden campaign declined to comment, but a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Courtney Parella, called Mr. Biden “an empty vessel filled by the radical left’s agenda.”John Holdren, Mr. Obama’s chief science adviser and a professor of environmental policy at Harvard University, said the effort was “misguided.” Mr. Holdren called Mr. Moniz “the best energy secretary in history,” noting he helped develop the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Most researchers, including himself, had accepted funding from energy companies, he said, and have pushed the private sector to tackle climate change.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign Up“We are not going to solve the climate problem over the dead bodies of the private sector,” Mr. Holdren said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Bordoff and Ms. Zichal declined to comment. In a statement, Mr. Salazar said of Mr. Biden, “As vice president, he helped spearhead the effort that unleashed the renewable energy revolution including permitting over 20,000 megawatts of renewable energy on public lands. In implementing the Biden climate change agenda, I am certain he will surround himself with the best people to implement that agenda.”Mr. Moniz said in a statement, “Everything must be on the table to meet the challenging but essential target of net-zero emissions by midcentury,” adding, “Building broad coalitions, bringing together labor, industry, policymakers and the environmental community, will be essential.”At the heart of the debate is averting the worst consequences of climate change and what role natural gas should continue to play.Scientists widely agree that net emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide must be zero by 2050. Mr. Biden has laid out a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to support clean energy, electric vehicles and energy-efficient homes. Emissions from the power sector would be eliminated by 2035.The Obama administration argued that natural gas, which produces about half the carbon emissions as coal but also emits methane, another greenhouse gas, is a necessary “bridge” to clean power. Its growth is a large reason U.S. emissions have declined over the past decade.Yet many energy experts agree that the United States no longer needs to build new natural gas plants to meet energy demands. Currently the United States meets just under 40 percent of its electricity demand through clean energy — a mixture of nuclear power and renewables like wind and solar. A recent report by GridLab, a private think tank, and the University of California at Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy found that the United States could reach 90 percent clean energy by 2035 without increasing customer bills from today’s levels.Leah C. Stokes, an energy policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said the final 10 percent would quite likely come from natural gas, playing “a somewhat marginal backup role in the system.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If you really want to limit warming, it’s not rocket science,” she said. “Stop building fossil fuel infrastructure.”Mr. Biden has cited climate change as one of “four historic crises” facing the country, along with the coronavirus, the economic downturn and racial injustice. Mr. Biden can use it to draw a sharp contrast with Mr. Trump, whose disregard for science links his approach to environmental policy with his handling of the pandemic.Mr. Biden has also taken care to frame combating climate change as an economic opportunity. At a virtual fund-raiser on Thursday whose hosts included Mr. Salazar, Mr. Biden said: “When Trump thinks of climate change, he can barely muster one word. He calls it a hoax. I think of one word, too: jobs.”As the fight over personnel heats up, climate experts also are pressing Mr. Biden to continue playing offense. Democratic strategists say that is likely to energize younger voters, who prioritize climate change, while also appealing to college-educated suburban voters put off by the president’s science denial.“Obviously the Republicans will attack Democrats for going too far,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, “but I would much rather be playing the hand of somebody who takes climate change seriously than playing the hand of somebody who describes it as a hoax.”Lisa Friedman reported from Washington, and Thomas Kaplan from Connecticut.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

Capturing the Faces of Climate Migration,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.According to one projection, at least 13 million people in the United States will be forced to move by 2100 because of climate change. That migration in America is the focus of this weekend’s issue of The New York Times Magazine, the second part of a series on global human migration caused by rising sea levels, wildfires, hurricanes and more. Both articles feature images by Meridith Kohut, a photojournalist who documents humanitarian issues and who captured families and workers facing this reality. In an edited interview, she talked about the assignment.Having first photographed this story around Latin America, how different was it photographing in the United States?I’ve covered humanitarian crises internationally for over a decade, and this year is one of the first times I’ve ever worked covering my home country. You think America is more insulated from the devastation of climate change, but the past year has shown me that that’s just not true.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDid anything strike you as you photographed Latin America, and then the States, where many of those migrants are heading?When I was in Guatemala, a lot of the farmers in Alta Verapaz were growing maize, and they were showing me their harvests. The stalk would grow, the corncob would grow, but there would be hardly any kernels, so they couldn’t really eat it or sell it. When I went to Ramona Farms, an organic farm in the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, they went out to harvest organic blue corn. They opened up the corn husks and it looked exactly the same. It’s heartbreaking to see everything the migrants in Latin America are sacrificing and risking to make the trip north. They’re putting all of their hope in thinking things will be better here, but it’s pretty bleak here too.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Looking through your photos, there’s a kind of sweetness to some of them. What did you want your approach to be?The story is data-driven, and Abrahm Lustgarten had already finished writing it before I started working on the photographs. Statistics and charts and scientific models can sometimes be hard for people to relate to. My job was to humanize the data — to go out and tell the stories of the people living with what the data shows. My approach was to try to document the emotional toll it takes on people who lose their homes, the seniors who spend their days just trying to survive the heat, and hopefully do it in a way that touches our readers’ hearts and inspire them to take action to help reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyYou wrapped up this story fairly recently, is that correct?Yes. The original plan was to photograph this part of the series in the spring, and document communities that are still rebuilding, years after being destroyed by fires or hurricanes, but Covid-19 caused the story to get put on hold, and I spent the spring documenting the pandemic instead. It was August before I could head out to start working on this story, and August ended up breaking extreme-weather records across the board. I witnessed the most destructive wildfire season ever in California, Arizona’s record-setting heat wave and Hurricane Laura in Louisiana.ImageA firefighter works to protect a home from burning in the Lake Hughes area of northern Los Angeles County. The wildfire was among the extreme-weather events that Meridith Kohut photographed in August.Credit...Meridith Kohut for The New York TimesWith weather being such a factor in making your job easier or harder, what kinds of challenges were you encountering?Oh yeah, my cameras got utterly and completely filthy. We were right up on the fireline at multiple fires, and it was raining ash. All over my cameras, all over me. It was very hot, and the thick smoke made it hard to breathe at times, and burned my eyes and throat. The fires can move quickly when the wind picks up, so you’re constantly having to be situationally aware and plan escape routes. I drove into Hurricane Laura at dawn, with a search-and-rescue caravan, a few hours after it made landfall. It was a difficult drive — pouring rain made it hard to see the road, and I had to dodge debris, as strong gusts of wind pushed my truck around on the highway. Power lines were down all over, blocking roads. There was no gasoline, electricity or running water.The hotel The New York Times had booked for me was destroyed, so I slept in my truck for days. My editor felt really bad about it, but after over a decade living and working in Venezuela I’m pretty used to challenging field conditions. “Oh my gosh, you had to sleep in your truck!” she said. “Are you kidding?” I responded, “I was in a Walmart parking lot! It was so nice!”Was there anything else about your work that was new to you?I’ve covered several natural disasters around the world before, but this was my first time ever photographing a wildfire. The wide landscape fire shots, like the cover photo, were made at night, using a tripod and long camera exposure. I usually shoot everything hand-held, using natural light, so I was definitely out of my comfort zone photographing the fires. I took wildland firefighting classes online to learn about how fires move, and I had to wear all of the same P.P.E. that the firefighters use. ",nytimes,"Capturing the Faces of Climate Migration at the Field TripBryan Stewart (IOP/GT), The State and Policy (University of California, Santa Cruz)1. For the past few years I've seen the dynamics of movement within the Climate Movement so closely intertwined that it's difficult to overstate the extent to which they were born as inseparable forces. I'm sure one author predicted that just when it seemed like an existential danger, some climate movement would be crushed by a war effort. The two sides in this matter are connected. I have not been able to agree on much; though I've seen a number of climate activists believe (though not totally assured) that the CIPE is headed toward the kind of apocalyptic goals of the climate movement that the climatologists are hoping for. My guess is that.What I mean by ""scientist""—there are a couple of interesting terms here—is that of the co-ordinated development of a phenomenon known as ""global warming,"" much like the ""tropical cyclone.""

"Heat and Drought Team Up More Frequently, With Disastrous Results","The combination of drought conditions and heat waves, which can make wildfires more likely, is becoming increasingly common in the American West, according to a new study. The results may be predictably disastrous.It has been well established that both droughts and heat waves have been occurring more frequently in recent decades. And while those conditions can cause damage singly, “their concurrence can be even more devastating,” the authors wrote.What used to be a rare weather double whammy has been occurring more frequently in recent decades because of climate change, said Mojtaba Sadegh, an assistant professor of civil engineering at Boise State University and an author of the new study, published Wednesday in Science Advances. “These events, dry-hot events, are intensifying,” he said. “This is rising at an alarming rate.”The new paper extends the historical weather record from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration back 122 years and examines heat and drought events that occurred across the contiguous United States.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe researchers found that the two phenomena feed each other in an intensifying cycle. They can also spread downwind, expanding drought and heat into broader areas like a storm front spreads rain, so “that self intensification will happen in a new region,” Dr. Sadegh said.While the researchers expected that the records they examined would show an increase in the combined events, “we didn’t expect to see the increase at this magnitude.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

And levels of drought and extreme heat that, in the absence of the warming brought about by climate change, might have been expected to recur once every 75 years hit the Northwest five or six times between 1993 and 2017.ImageA ranch in California’s Central Valley. A new study finds that heatwaves and drought are occurring at the same time more often as the climate changes. Credit...Frederic J. Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesWhile people generally look at climate phenomena within the context of what they have known in their lifetimes, “those norms, in terms of climate, might not mean anything from now on — or they might not have meant anything for a while, and we’re just now realizing it,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe new study also examined the combined drought and heat conditions that happened during the 1930s drought that led to the Dust Bowl. That national tragedy was driven largely by lack of rainfall, which led to the air becoming hotter, and poor land management practices that caused astonishing dust storms, the scientists said. But recent dry-hot disasters are driven more by excess heat than a lack of rainfall.So the triggering mechanism for heat-drought events is shifting, according to the researchers, from lack of rain to excess heat. The authors conclude that “if meteorological droughts of the length and severity observed in the 1930s occur during the hot years that are increasingly common in recent decades due to global warming, their concurrence can have devastating impacts.”What’s more, they wrote, no major region of the continental United States is immune to severe droughts. They warn that the increased heat makes megadroughts more likely.Perhaps most chillingly, they cite research that warns that the heat from climate change will increase demand for water and lead to scarcity. That could put strains on national infrastructure and society that, the scientists wrote, “might push them to unprecedented states.”ImageA ranch in California’s Central Valley. A new study finds that heatwaves and drought are occurring at the same time more often as the climate changes. Credit...Frederic J. Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA climate scientist who was not involved in the study, Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles, said the new research expands on previous work that focused on the West. The most important finding of the new paper, he suggested, was the increasing importance of heat as the driver of droughts. The warming global temperatures, he said, “are making it easier to achieve historically rare levels of dryness.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDr. Swain recently noted in a series of comments posted on Twitter that California, and possibly the Pacific Northwest as a whole, are likely to see another severe heat wave in early October, which could “bring extreme wildfire burning conditions once again.”The new study, he said, does a good job of describing how drought and wildfire conditions spread and can occur over broad regions at the same time, making fire management much harder. “We are certainly seeing this with respect to wildfire in 2020,” he said.Dr. Sadegh noted that the nation has done little to address the changing conditions and continues to build new homes in wildfire-prone areas, yet “every year there is a new record,” he said. With 3.6 million acres burned this year in California alone, and five of the six biggest wildfires in the state’s history occurring in 2020, the answer, he said, is to address the issue of climate change squarely.“This is only getting worse,” he said, “until we act on it and reduce emissions.”",nytimes,"Heat and Drought Team Up More Frequently, With Disastrous Results on the Field.Basketball: A Brought-In Move The Right Way With The Need To Make Super-Faster, More Intelligent, Safer-Than-Most PerfectBasketball: Brought-In Changes What The Player Does.

Democratic Donors Push Biden for a Cabinet Free of Fossil Fuel Connections,"WASHINGTON — Liberal activists have opened a new front in their battle to push Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the left on climate change: a campaign to pressure the Democratic presidential nominee to reject advisers with any ties to fossil fuel companies.The targets include former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and others who served in the Obama administration.Last week more than 60 deep-pocketed donors asked Mr. Biden to commit to a moratorium on all new coal, oil and natural gas development — and to select advisers who are “free from fossil fuel influence.” The group, which includes Kathy Washienko, a clean-energy investor in Seattle; Robin Chase, a co-founder and former chief executive of Zipcar; and Adelaide Park Gomer, the president of the Park Foundation philanthropic group and a longtime anti-fracking activist, implored Mr. Biden to “choose new, bolder leadership” than those with whom he worked under President Barack Obama.“This incumbency of old ideas (like ‘all of the above’ energy policy) must end,” the donors wrote.The effort comes just days after Mr. Biden denounced President Trump as a “climate arsonist” and made the case that Americans suffering from wildfires, floods and hurricanes could not afford four more years of a climate-change denier in the White House. Even many of Mr. Biden’s persistent critics on the left described it as the most aggressive and detailed policy speech on climate change ever given by a presidential candidate.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe campaign held a phone bank on Thursday devoted to climate change, at which a campaign official, David Kieve, described Mr. Biden as having “the most progressive set of climate policies that anyone has ever run on in a general election before in history, period.”Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led group that has been skeptical of the former vice president, praised Mr. Biden’s address as “one of the best climate speeches that a Democratic presidential candidate has made.”Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.“He has moved a thousand yards on this in the last year and a half, and I believe it shows leadership,” Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said in an interview.But tensions remain, particularly over Mr. Biden’s commitment to eliminating fossil fuels.Environmental groups have tried and failed to convince Mr. Biden to call for a nationwide ban on fracking. He has pledged a ban on new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters but assured union leaders in critical swing states like Pennsylvania that he will protect existing fracking jobs while pursuing a clean energy transition.At a CNN town hall on Thursday, Mr. Biden insisted that hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, or fracking, “has to continue because we need a transition” to renewable energy.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The worry for those of us who want to see bolder action is that Biden isn’t going to be willing to move further,” said Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, a group that this month distributed a letter from 145 environmental organizations calling on Mr. Biden to bar fossil fuel executives, lobbyists and representatives from his campaign and administration.The list of those targeted includes Mr. Moniz, who in 2018 joined the board of Southern Company, an electric utility that sued the Obama administration over its Clean Power Plan climate change regulations. Another target: Mr. Salazar, Mr. Obama’s first interior secretary, who is now a partner at the law firm WilmerHale and in 2019 opposed a planned overhaul of oil and gas regulations in Colorado. In July, the campaign named Mr. Salazar a co-chairman of its Latino leadership committee.Lesser-known aides to Mr. Obama who have come into the groups’ cross hairs include Heather Zichal, an architect of the Clean Power Plan who served on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquefied natural gas company, and Jason Bordoff, a former senior director on the National Security Council who founded the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. The university, like many academic institutions, accepts funding from energy companies.“We can’t have people who are beholden to the fossil fuel industry in any way shape or form,” said Barbara Beseda Grasseschi, a Democratic fund-raiser in Sonoma County, Calif., who along with her husband, Tony Crabb, signed the Democratic donors’ letter.

Organizers shared the letter but not the full list of signatories.The Biden campaign declined to comment, but a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Courtney Parella, called Mr. Biden “an empty vessel filled by the radical left’s agenda.”John Holdren, Mr. Obama’s chief science adviser and a professor of environmental policy at Harvard University, said the effort was “misguided.” Mr. Holdren called Mr. Moniz “the best energy secretary in history,” noting he helped develop the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Most researchers, including himself, had accepted funding from energy companies, he said, and have pushed the private sector to tackle climate change.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign Up“We are not going to solve the climate problem over the dead bodies of the private sector,” Mr. Holdren said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Bordoff and Ms. Zichal declined to comment. In a statement, Mr. Salazar said of Mr. Biden, “As vice president, he helped spearhead the effort that unleashed the renewable energy revolution including permitting over 20,000 megawatts of renewable energy on public lands. In implementing the Biden climate change agenda, I am certain he will surround himself with the best people to implement that agenda.”Mr. Moniz said in a statement, “Everything must be on the table to meet the challenging but essential target of net-zero emissions by midcentury,” adding, “Building broad coalitions, bringing together labor, industry, policymakers and the environmental community, will be essential.”At the heart of the debate is averting the worst consequences of climate change and what role natural gas should continue to play.Scientists widely agree that net emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide must be zero by 2050. Mr. Biden has laid out a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to support clean energy, electric vehicles and energy-efficient homes. Emissions from the power sector would be eliminated by 2035.The Obama administration argued that natural gas, which produces about half the carbon emissions as coal but also emits methane, another greenhouse gas, is a necessary “bridge” to clean power. Its growth is a large reason U.S. emissions have declined over the past decade.Yet many energy experts agree that the United States no longer needs to build new natural gas plants to meet energy demands. Currently the United States meets just under 40 percent of its electricity demand through clean energy — a mixture of nuclear power and renewables like wind and solar. A recent report by GridLab, a private think tank, and the University of California at Berkeley’s Goldman School of Public Policy found that the United States could reach 90 percent clean energy by 2035 without increasing customer bills from today’s levels.Leah C. Stokes, an energy policy expert at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said the final 10 percent would quite likely come from natural gas, playing “a somewhat marginal backup role in the system.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If you really want to limit warming, it’s not rocket science,” she said. “Stop building fossil fuel infrastructure.”Mr. Biden has cited climate change as one of “four historic crises” facing the country, along with the coronavirus, the economic downturn and racial injustice. Mr. Biden can use it to draw a sharp contrast with Mr. Trump, whose disregard for science links his approach to environmental policy with his handling of the pandemic.Mr. Biden has also taken care to frame combating climate change as an economic opportunity. At a virtual fund-raiser on Thursday whose hosts included Mr. Salazar, Mr. Biden said: “When Trump thinks of climate change, he can barely muster one word. He calls it a hoax. I think of one word, too: jobs.”As the fight over personnel heats up, climate experts also are pressing Mr. Biden to continue playing offense. Democratic strategists say that is likely to energize younger voters, who prioritize climate change, while also appealing to college-educated suburban voters put off by the president’s science denial.“Obviously the Republicans will attack Democrats for going too far,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, “but I would much rather be playing the hand of somebody who takes climate change seriously than playing the hand of somebody who describes it as a hoax.”Lisa Friedman reported from Washington, and Thomas Kaplan from Connecticut.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

Trump’s Motto: Your Money or Your Life,"Whenever I talk about Covid-19 or climate change with skeptics, I use a simple analogy: Imagine that your child is sick with a disease and you decide to take her to 100 different doctors to get multiple opinions — and 99 doctors give you the same diagnosis and prescribed treatment and one tells you that there’s nothing to worry about, that your child’s disease will “disappear … like a miracle, it will disappear.”What parents in their right minds would follow the advice of the doctor with the one-out-of-100 diagnosis?This, alas, is no hypothetical. This, alas, is actually the most important question facing voters in choosing our next president. Are you ready to trust your own child’s and the country’s health to the guy who holds the one-out-of-100 view on both climate change and Covid-19? He being Dr. Donald Trump, founder of Trump University, where he apparently earned a B.S. in B.S.It is stunning to me how many conservatives want to go with the doctor with the one-out-of-100 diagnosis, since doing so is anything but conservative.

Trump’s implicit motto when it comes to Covid-19 and environmental protection is always the same: Your money OR your life?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhich do you value more? Biden’s motto has been your money AND your life — you should not, and do not, have to choose between them, if we are wise and follow science.How so? On Covid-19, for Trump, it’s jobs or masks, opening school or masks, social distancing or Big Ten football, science or church. Everything is black or white. And so is the result: So many Americans are jobless today and watching their kids learning remotely from home because Trump pitted masks against in-classroom schooling, masks against jobs, masks against indoor restaurant dining and masks against gathering for church services.And too many Americans chose jobs and school and church out of desperation, and they’ve already paid the price or will pay it.Biden, by contrast, is a unifier. He’s argued that if everyone wears a mask, practices social distancing and gets tested, we can BOTH protect many more jobs AND protect many more lives. Masks are not at war with jobs; they are the driver and protector of job growth in a pandemic. Masks are the vehicle to opening schools and other indoor activities — not their enemy. Just ask the Germans, Singaporeans or South Koreans.Ditto when it comes to the environment and climate change. Trump wants everyone to believe that protecting nature means unemploying people. It’s clean air OR economic growth. It’s gas guzzlers OR unemployment.

Trump’s Motto: Your Money or Your Life,"Whenever I talk about Covid-19 or climate change with skeptics, I use a simple analogy: Imagine that your child is sick with a disease and you decide to take her to 100 different doctors to get multiple opinions — and 99 doctors give you the same diagnosis and prescribed treatment and one tells you that there’s nothing to worry about, that your child’s disease will “disappear … like a miracle, it will disappear.”What parents in their right minds would follow the advice of the doctor with the one-out-of-100 diagnosis?This, alas, is no hypothetical. This, alas, is actually the most important question facing voters in choosing our next president. Are you ready to trust your own child’s and the country’s health to the guy who holds the one-out-of-100 view on both climate change and Covid-19? He being Dr. Donald Trump, founder of Trump University, where he apparently earned a B.S. in B.S.It is stunning to me how many conservatives want to go with the doctor with the one-out-of-100 diagnosis, since doing so is anything but conservative. It’s Trotskyite radical.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAnd to riff off Trotsky for another moment, Republicans may not be interested in Mother Nature, but Mother Nature is interested in them. Both climate change and Covid-19 have brutally elbowed their way into our lives in the past year, and for the same reason: We have been stressing our ecosystems to their limits and beyond.We’ve done this by invading wilderness areas and extracting wildlife carrying viruses never borne before by human beings and by emitting CO₂ that is heating the planet, amplifying storms that brought four months of rain in four hours in Florida and wildfires of epic proportions to the West Coast.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Joe Biden wants to proceed with more caution, and Trump wants to throw caution to the wind. That’s why the widely respected science journal Scientific American did something last week for the first time, declaring: “Scientific American has never endorsed a presidential candidate in our 175-year history — until now. The 2020 election is literally a matter of life and death. We urge you to vote for health, science and Joe Biden for President.”ImageJoe Biden sees past Trump’s false choices.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesThe choice could not be more stark or important. Trump’s implicit motto when it comes to Covid-19 and environmental protection is always the same: Your money OR your life?AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhich do you value more? Biden’s motto has been your money AND your life — you should not, and do not, have to choose between them, if we are wise and follow science.How so? On Covid-19, for Trump, it’s jobs or masks, opening school or masks, social distancing or Big Ten football, science or church. Everything is black or white. And so is the result: So many Americans are jobless today and watching their kids learning remotely from home because Trump pitted masks against in-classroom schooling, masks against jobs, masks against indoor restaurant dining and masks against gathering for church services.And too many Americans chose jobs and school and church out of desperation, and they’ve already paid the price or will pay it.Biden, by contrast, is a unifier. He’s argued that if everyone wears a mask, practices social distancing and gets tested, we can BOTH protect many more jobs AND protect many more lives. Masks are not at war with jobs; they are the driver and protector of job growth in a pandemic. Masks are the vehicle to opening schools and other indoor activities — not their enemy. Just ask the Germans, Singaporeans or South Koreans.Ditto when it comes to the environment and climate change. Trump wants everyone to believe that protecting nature means unemploying people. It’s clean air OR economic growth. It’s gas guzzlers OR unemployment. He’s forever pitting jobs against nature.Biden stands for the unity of jobs AND the environment, the unity of jobs AND mitigating climate change.

E.P.A. to Promote Lead Testing Rule as Trump Tries to Burnish His Record,"WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to overhaul the way communities test their water for lead, a policy change that will be pitched ahead of Election Day as a major environmental achievement for a president not noted for his conservation record.But a draft of the final rule obtained by The New York Times shows the E.P.A. rejected top medical and scientific experts who urged the agency to require the replacement of the country’s six million to 10 million lead service lines, an expensive but effective way to avoid crises like the one still afflicting Flint, Mich.The measure is the first major update in nearly three decades to the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, a regulation aimed at protecting drinking water from lead, a potent neurotoxin that has been linked to developmental problems in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said there is no safe level of lead exposure for children, and the new rule requires for the first time testing for lead in all schools and day care centers.“The rule will better identify high levels of lead, improve the reliability of lead tap sampling results, strengthen corrosion control treatment requirements, expand consumer awareness and improve risk communication,” the draft from mid-July said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut rather than enact the sweeping changes that some health leaders say are necessary, the E.P.A. is opting for more modest improvements. Some experts and critics said the new rule actually weakens the current rule in significant ways, for instance, by more than doubling the amount of time utilities can have to replace water systems with serious levels of lead contamination.“What’s the point of making the change?” said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, whose state enacted the country’s toughest lead standard for drinking water in the wake of the Flint disaster. Michigan also has required water suppliers to replace all lead service lines on public and private property before January 1, 2041.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.“Originally, we were encouraged that the Trump administration said they wanted to update the rule,” Governor Whitmer said. But when told of the final rule, she called it “sorely disappointing.”James Hewitt, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said in a statement that it is “premature to draw any conclusions on a rule that is still undergoing interagency review.” He added that the Trump administration “is committed to finally acting to better protect our children’s health and holistically address lead in America’s water systems.”Andrew Wheeler, the administrator of the E.P.A., has described the rule in recent speeches as a core achievement of the agency under Mr. Trump, who often boasts of producing the “cleanest air” and the “cleanest water” even as he has dismantled nearly 70 environmental regulations and is pushing to roll back another 30.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The Obama-Biden administration claimed to have worked on it for eight years, with nothing to show,” Mr. Wheeler said of lead pipe regulations while speaking at the American Enterprise Institute last week. “They even had a wake-up call in Flint, Mich., in 2014 but still did nothing.”ImageAndrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, has described the new rule as a core achievement of the agency under Mr. Trump, Credit...Pool photo by Al DragoThe Lead and Copper Rule was enacted in 1991 to regulate the levels of lead in public water systems. The E.P.A. has said the updated version will identify the most at-risk communities and make sure that communities have in place plans to reduce elevated levels of lead.Schools and child care centers, for example, would be required to notify those who use their facilities of elevated lead levels within 24 hours of testing rather than the current 30 days. The rule also would require water utilities to conduct inventories of their lead service pipes and publicly report their locations.At a House hearing in February, Angela Licata, the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, was testifying on behalf of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, and said a mandate to replace all lead service lines was impractical. She praised the E.P.A. plan for avoiding “unattainable mandates.”

His administration is the one that proposed lifting the moratorium in the first place.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign UpCabinet members like Mr. Wheeler have sought to make the case that while the Obama administration focused on distant issues like climate change, Mr. Trump has actually zeroed in on environmental issues close to home, like the quality of the water coming from taps.During his speech in Florida, Mr. Trump said his administration was “strengthening standards to prevent vulnerable children from being exposed to lead and copper in drinking water, including in our schools,” adding, “They were exposed to lead and copper in drinking water. We’ve done some job with that, that was an important one.”Republican strategists said Mr. Trump’s campaign might be trying to improve his standing among suburban women and other swing voters. But they also doubted it would pay off.“Trump’s not going to lead on climate obviously, so they have to look at specific problems they can try to solve,” said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican Party. He said promoting things like the update to the Lead and Copper Rule was a good strategy for Mr. Trump — but only because the administration had “tied one hand behind its back” by refusing to even engage on climate change.Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster, conceded, “If you are an environmental voter in 2020, you are voting for Joe Biden.” The Trump administration’s efforts on lead in water “won’t change a single vote,” he continued, even among undecided voters.ImageA lead pipe removed last year from under a street in Newark.Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesTwo former E.P.A. officials described the new rule as insufficient. Ronnie Levin, a public health professor at Harvard University who spent 37 years at the E.P.A. pioneering lead protections in water, paint and gasoline, said the agency’s political leaders shut its scientific experts out of deliberations on the new measure.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMiguel Del Toral, who recently retired from the E.P.A. in Chicago, where he also worked for more than 30 years on lead, agreed.“They had their minds made up about what they wanted and didn’t want in the rule, and we kept banging our heads against the wall arguing science,” Mr. Del Toral said.Asked whether career E.P.A. scientists were shut out of the process, Mr. Hewitt, the agency spokesman, said, “Our career drinking water experts are a driving force behind our more protective rulemaking.”Erik D. Olson, the senior strategic director for health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, said the slower timetable for replacing lead pipes was “a huge weakening,” adding that “it will mean another generation of kids will be drinking lead-contaminated water.”Under the old rule, utilities had to replace some of their lead service lines if they repeatedly tested above the E.P.A.’s “action level” of 15 parts per billion. They were given about 14 years for the full replacement. The new rule will give them approximately 33 years to fully replace the service lines, Mr. Olson said. If utilities repeatedly test between 10 and 15 parts per billion, water systems will be required to confer with state authorities to develop “a goal rate” for replacing their lead lines, but the rule does not provide a deadline for doing so.Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Michigan pediatrician whose research exposed the Flint water crisis, called the new rule “heartbreaking.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We have really failed at a national level to learn the lessons of Flint,” she said. “A poison that has no safe level is in our drinking water.

Election and Supreme Court Fight Will Decide Trump’s Environmental Legacy,"[Update: President Trump has selected Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court.]WASHINGTON — President Trump has initiated the most aggressive environmental deregulation agenda in modern history, but as his first term drives to a close, many of his policies are being cut down by the courts — even by Republican-appointed jurists who the administration had hoped would be friendly.Those losses have actually heightened the stakes in the election and the fight over a replacement on the Supreme Court for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A second term, coupled with a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court, could save some of his biggest environmental rollbacks.Since January courts have dealt a series of blows to the Trump administration’s plans to ramp up fossil fuel development and undo decades of environmental protections. This month, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked implementation of a major rollback of methane emissions standards for the oil and gas industry while it considers permanent action. That followed decisions by judges that have thrown the future of the Dakota Access Pipeline into doubt, struck down the relaxation of protections for migratory birds and vacated the rollback of an Obama-era rule to reduce waste from natural gas flaring on federal lands.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyFive recent unfavorable rulings came from Republican-appointed judges, including a 6-3 clean water decision in April by the Supreme Court with Justice Ginsburg in the majority. A panel of three judges appointed by President Trump unanimously overturned a policy that would have suspended hefty new penalties for automakers who failed to meet fuel efficiency standards.According to a database kept by New York University’s nonpartisan Institute for Policy Integrity, the Environmental Protection Agency has won only nine out of 47 cases in court under Mr. Trump, while the Interior Department has won four of 22. The Trump administration’s overall win rate hovers just under 16 percent, the group said, compared to win rates of about 70 percent for both the Obama and Bush administrations.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.But the courts have in most cases given the administration an opportunity to go back and revise their work. The future of those rules may then rest on whether Mr. Trump is re-elected, with a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court ready to hear his fresh attempts.“If there is a second Trump administration they may have time to go back and do it right,” said Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.Trump administration officials and supporters dispute the institute’s statistics and contend they have obtained mostly favorable outcomes. On Sept. 11, for example, the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia declined to block the Trump administration’s overhaul of the National Environmental Policy Act from taking effect, pending an ultimate decision on the legality of the regulatory changes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut even conservative legal scholars said the mounting losses are impossible to ignore.“There is a sense that the administration has been in a hurry and has been sloppy,” said Jonathan H. Adler, a conservative legal expert and professor of environmental law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.Courts have yet to rule on Mr. Trump’s biggest rollbacks of clean water rules, curbs to greenhouse gas emissions in automobiles and power plants, and environmental reviews of infrastructure projects. But activists and Democratic attorneys general expressed confidence that judges would find the unwinding of even those environmental protections illegal, despite the work that went into them.Early in the administration, a number of courts ruled that agencies acted illegally by providing little or no justification when they rewrote, weakened or repealed regulation.Now courts are increasingly telling the E.P.A. and Interior Department that their legal, scientific and economic analyses upholding rollbacks directly violate underlying laws.ImageThe Trump administration had sought to change the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to eliminate penalties for energy companies that kill birds “incidentally.”Credit...Brandon Thibodeaux for The New York TimesSome of the decisions have been scathing.“It is not only a sin to kill a mockingbird, it is also a crime. That has been the letter of the law for the past century. But if the Department of the Interior has its way, many mockingbirds and other migratory birds that delight people and support ecosystems throughout the country will be killed without legal consequence,” Judge Valerie Caproni of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in an August ruling that blocked the Trump administration’s relaxation of protections for migratory birds.In a statement, the Interior Department said it still intended to move forward with a final rule on the changes.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn the case overturning the Trump administration’s relaxation of penalties for automakers, the three Republican judges found “no ambiguity” in the statute that Congress passed in 2015 ordering federal agencies to adjust a wide range of civil penalties to account for inflation.

And in August a panel of two judges appointed by Republicans and one appointed by a Democrat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the E.P.A.’s 2019 approval of an air pollution rule for Pennsylvania that would have allowed coal-fired power plants in that state to exceed pollution limits.The court typically gives the federal agency deference in decision-making, the judges wrote. But they said, “To receive such deference, the agency cannot reach whatever conclusion it likes and then defend it with vague allusions to its own expertise; instead, the agency must support its conclusion with demonstrable reasoning based on the facts in the record.”Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign UpThe E.P.A. contends it has been successful in the majority of its significant cases. In an opinion article for Bloomberg Law, the agency’s general counsel, Matthew Z. Leopold, pointed to cases like a federal court ruling in August that rejected a request from 17 states to block the Trump administration’s revisions to a rule that significantly narrows the definition of which bodies of water are federally regulated, and a 2019 federal appeals court ruling that upheld the E.P.A.’s decision not to finalize an Obama-era requirement that mining operators prove they can pay for cleanup in the event of a disaster.Jeffrey H. Wood, who served as acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s environment and natural resources division under Mr. Trump and is now a partner at the law firm Baker Botts, agreed: “The current record shows that D.O.J. and E.P.A. are making a solid defense of the Trump administration priorities.”Similarly, a spokesman for the Department of Interior said the agency’s success rate has been “impressive,” pointing to a March decision in which a federal judge upheld a decision to repeal Obama-era standards for hydraulic fracturing on public lands.Mr. Leopold and Mr. Wood, in interviews, both said the N.Y.U. rating system wrongly classified a case as “unsuccessful” for the administration if the court identified any flaw in the agency’s work. They argued that courts often find defects in government actions but allow the policy to go into effect.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPatrick J. Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia who relentlessly sued the Obama administration over coal regulations, said administration critics had left out important wins, like a Supreme Court decision that declined to block a pipeline delivering natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina.“The Trump administration, along with allies like me, wins on big-picture issues at the highest levels,” Mr. Morrisey said.ImageThe site where the Keystone XL oil pipeline would cross into the United States from Canada in Phillips County, Mont.Credit...Al Nash/Bureau of Land Management, via Associated PressXavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, who recently filed his 100th lawsuit against the administration, said the flaws in this administration’s regulatory efforts were consistent.“The Trump administration is impatient,” he said. “The Trump administration is sloppy. The Trump administration doesn’t like to do its homework.”He argued Democratic attorneys general, who have been pounding the administration with lawsuits, have three things on their side: “The facts, the science and the law.”Mr. Gerrard said one notable trend in the administration’s losses was that courts are objecting to regulatory analyses that are supposed to back up policies but make no mention of the policies’ impact on climate change. In May, the United States District Court for the District of Montana vacated 287 oil and gas leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management in 2017 and 2018 because the agency had failed to examine the leases’ cumulative climate impacts.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySimilarly, a federal court ruling in July 2019 granted a preliminary injunction to conservation groups that challenged the renewal of grazing permits in Oregon because, the judges found, the Bureau of Land Management had failed to consider the effects of climate change.And, in 2018, a federal judge in Montana ordered the Trump administration and TransCanada to stop work on the Keystone XL pipeline, saying Mr. Trump’s approval of the project violated laws by ignoring facts about climate change.“The administration is so reluctant to mention climate change that they get in trouble for not even mentioning it,” Mr. Gerrard said.He and other regulatory experts noted that if Joseph R. Biden Jr. gets into the White House in January, he will have to provide a written explanation of the reasons he wants to roll back each Trump administration action. Eliminating Trump’s executive orders will be relatively easy, but going through the regulatory process all over again on issues like fuel efficiency standards will take time.That would make lawsuits brought by Democratic attorneys general all the more important because they will have kept many rules from going into effect while their replacements wind their way through the regulatory process.“A lot of these rollbacks are going to have very shallow roots, and perhaps no roots as all,” said David Hayes, executive director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.James E.

"After Fire and Floods, Glimmers of Hope","During the increasingly common ecological disasters that visit this country, there inevitably arises the hope that Americans and their elected politicians will learn from the experience, adopt new policies and provide for a less destructive future. We are now in such a period, with two unfolding climate-fueled disasters occurring at once: Savage wildfires in the West that have consumed more than five million acres of forests and scrublands and taken multiple lives in four states, and a Category 2 hurricane that has brought dangerous flooding and widespread damage to the Florida Panhandle.Once again, disaster has yielded glimmers of hope, or at least evidence of common sense. A recent Times article by Christopher Flavelle, a Washington-based climate reporter, notes that Americans by substantial margins support much stronger building codes and even outright bans on new construction in flood- and fire-prone zones. Eighty-four percent of people surveyed supported mandatory building codes in risky areas, and well over half supported outright bans. One interesting aspect of these findings — drawn from a joint survey by Stanford University, the environmental research group Resources for the Future and the survey company ReconMR — is that a majority of Republicans favored tougher rules. That’s surprising because Republicans tend to be much more skeptical about global warming than Democrats and, more to the point, much more hostile to government regulation.The survey, however, also highlights a depressing underside: While the public’s appreciation of the dangers of building in risky areas may be shifting, attitudes in state and local governments and the real estate industry have hardly budged. These are the entities that hold the cards when it comes to residential construction. For all sorts of reasons, not least the need for property tax revenues for schools and other purposes, local communities want to build, even when the environmental risks seem self-evident. According to the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, an advocacy group that works to strengthen homes from natural and man-made disasters, just one-third of local jurisdictions in the United States have adopted disaster-resistant building codes. Not surprisingly, the idea of flatly banning new homes outright in at-risk areas is anathema, even among climate-sensitive politicians. In an interview with The Associated Press last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who has adopted several useful fire-prevention measures, seemed nearly offended when asked whether he would ban home building in at-risk areas.“There is something that is truly Californian about the wilderness and the wild and the pioneering spirit,” Mr. Newsom said. “I am not advocating for no.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut what of those ordinary folks who say they’ve been newly sensitized to the dangers of global warming? The truth is that many of them are a bit like Mr. Newsom, unwilling to accept boundaries when their own desires are at stake. New rules and new fire codes are OK, even a ban in some places. Just don’t ban us!In the West, for instance, one study found that from 1990 to 2015, 32 million homes were built in fire-prone areas near forests, powerful evidence that for many people the lure of living near the wild is greater than their best instincts about the risks of living in increasingly dry and fire-prone areas.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.So, too, is the eternal lure of the seashore. A 2019 study undertaken by Climate Central, a New Jersey environmental science group, showed that even after Hurricane Sandy, home construction in flood-prone areas in many coastal states continued at a brisk pace. This could change: The present confluence of fires and floods is truly scary. But so far there is not much evidence that the growing evidence of trouble now and trouble ahead is actually changing behavior.Where was the president as the West burned and the Gulf Coast drowned? As usual, in his own special cocoon of denial surrounded by “alternative facts.” In one of the more risible moments of his presidency, Donald Trump went to Florida earlier this month and, with an eye to the state’s electoral votes, declared his support for two worthy causes — Everglades restoration and a ban on oil drilling off Florida’s coasts. Whereupon he also anointed himself “the No. 1 environmental president since Teddy Roosevelt” — an appraisal that would come as a huge surprise to, among others, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, whose various environmental legacies, in particular Mr. Obama’s, Mr. Trump has spent the better part of four years trying to subvert.His true colors resurfaced when, a few days later, after weeks of silence on California’s agony, Mr. Trump added a side trip to Sacramento for a briefing on the fires. He showed almost no empathy for ordinary Californians and insisted, as he had before, that the crisis arose largely from the state’s mismanagement of its forests, the majority of which are in fact a federal responsibility. As for the long-accepted view that global warming is turbocharging floods and fires, he said the science of climate change was suspect and the scientists were confused.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyTo give Mr. Trump his due, it is quite true that the debris and dead trees that have accumulated over the years in forests in California and elsewhere provide massive amounts of fuel for especially destructive blazes. Unlike the president, who just points fingers, several prominent members of the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, have proposed legislation that would increase the Forest Service’s underfunded controlled burning program — that is, prescribed and carefully monitored fires — to clear out vegetation.Though tardy, a systematic sweep of the forests could be a useful byproduct of the fire. But it would be of even greater benefit for the issue of climate change to remain near the center of the national political conversation, where the floods and fires have pushed it. Joe Biden was so enraged by Mr. Trump’s cavalier attitude that he called the president a “climate arsonist.” An open letter from Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, the most learned of all senior Democrats on climate change, said it best: “There is no fire suppression plan on this planet that does anyone any good if it doesn’t even acknowledge the role of climate change.”For years, experts warned of the dangers of a pandemic. The pandemic never materialized, until it did. For years, scientists have warned of a climate catastrophe that will forever change life on planet Earth. The odds of that not happening will be greatly improved if, this time, Americans and their leaders pay attention to the science and act on the lessons they’ve learned.",nytimes,"After Fire and Floods, Glimmers of Hope created the world where human refugees are made to live out their long nights at The Pit so they can share experience, healing and creativity.Fate/stay night: there is a hopeAfter 2 weeks of planning, I decided to take the chance to launch Outof the City, a Kickstarter project of mine, and I'm big into a lot of things.

"As Trump Again Rejects Science, Biden Calls Him a ‘Climate Arsonist’","[Follow our daily updates on the latest presidential election polls.]WASHINGTON — With wildfires raging across the West, climate change took center stage in the race for the White House on Monday as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called President Trump a “climate arsonist” while the president said that “I don’t think science knows” what is actually happening.A day of dueling appearances laid out the stark differences between the two candidates, an incumbent president who has long scorned climate change as a hoax and rolled back environmental regulations and a challenger who has called for an aggressive campaign to curb the greenhouse gases blamed for increasingly extreme weather.Mr. Trump flew to California after weeks of public silence about the flames that have forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, wiped out communities and forests, burned millions of acres, shrouded the region in smoke and left at least 27 people dead. But even when confronted by California’s governor and other state officials, the president insisted on attributing the crisis solely to poor forest management, not climate change.Mr. Biden, for his part, assailed Mr. Trump’s record on the climate, asserting that the president’s inaction and denial had fed destruction, citing not just the current emergency on the West Coast but flooding in the Midwest and hurricanes along the Gulf Coast. In an outdoor speech at a museum in Wilmington, Del., the Democratic presidential nominee sought to paint a second Trump term as a danger to the nation’s suburbs, flipping an attack on him by the president.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” Mr. Biden asked. “How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms? If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?”The politicking came as firefighting teams across the West Coast battled shifting winds and drier weather on Monday, sparking additional fire fronts that threatened to make new kindling out of forests and cover more of the country with hazardous smoke and falling ash. By Monday afternoon, haze had spread across much of the United States and could be seen over New York and Washington.Maps: Fires and Air Quality in California, Oregon and WashingtonWhere major fires are burning in the Western states and how unhealthy air quality has become.Heavy smoke kept some firefighting aircraft grounded as fire pushed into new areas, prompting fresh evacuations in Idaho, Oregon and California.In Oregon, with a confirmed death toll of 10 along with 22 others missing, Gov. Kate Brown said the state was getting firefighting support from as far as North Dakota and Michigan. She expressed gratitude for the national assistance, saying the state could use all the help it could get. “Without question, our state has been pushed to its limits,” Ms. Brown said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDoug Grafe, the chief of fire protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry, said crews had made progress containing fires. But he said rains anticipated to fall Monday were not materializing and winds threatened to exacerbate fire conditions in some areas. Mr. Grafe said the rains that may now come on Wednesday or Thursday could also include lightning, raising the danger of new fires.ImageFirefighters battling the Bobcat Fire in Santa Anita Canyon near Los Angeles on Sunday. Fires have burned millions of acres across the West and shrouded the region in smoke.Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York TimesMr. Trump, who had come under intense criticism for barely addressing the crisis before, interrupted a western campaign swing to make a two-hour visit to an airport in McClellan Park outside Sacramento, where Air Force One descended through a smoky haze. Not far away, one of the biggest fires, now largely contained, recently burned more than 363,000 acres.As soon as the president disembarked from the plane at Sacramento McClellan Airport, where the stench of smoke filled the air, he did not wait for his scheduled briefing to tell reporters that the cause of the conflagration was poor forest management, not climate change.“When trees fall down after a short period of time, they become very dry — really like a matchstick,” Mr. Trump said. “And they can explode. Also leaves. When you have dried leaves on the ground, it’s just fuel for the fires.”At his subsequent briefing, however, Gov. Gavin Newsom and his top environmental adviser pushed the president to acknowledge the role of climate change. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, made a point of doing so exceedingly politely, reaffirming his working relationship with the president, thanking him for federal help and agreeing that forest management needed to be improved.But Mr. Newsom noted that only 3 percent of land in California is under state control while 57 percent is federal forest land, meaning under the president’s management as governed by federal law.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“As you suggest, the working relationship I value,” Mr. Newsom said. But he said climate change clearly was a factor. “Something’s happening to the plumbing of the world, and we come from a perspective, humbly, where we submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident that climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this.”He went on: “And so I think there’s an area of at least commonality on vegetation, forest management. But please respect — and I know you do — the difference of opinion out here as it relates to this fundamental issue on the issue of climate change.”Mr. Trump did not argue the point. “Absolutely,” he said, and then turned the floor over to another briefer.But Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary for natural resources, pressed Mr. Trump more bluntly. “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” he told the president.This time, Mr. Trump rejected the premise. “It’ll start getting cooler,” he insisted. “You just watch.”“I wish science agreed with you,” Mr. Crowfoot replied.“Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Mr. Trump retorted, maintaining a tense grin.Other California officials who were not present rejected Mr. Trump’s view. Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento said it was a positive development that the president made the trip to demonstrate concern. “Showing up matters,” he said in an interview. “But more important is what you actually do. The country desperately needs national leadership around the climate emergency.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySome environmental specialists said that Mr. Trump had a point about forest management but that it should not be an excuse to deny climate science and refuse to take action.“Raking the leaves and forest floors is really inane. That doesn’t make sense at all,” said Ralph Propper, the president of the Environmental Council of Sacramento. “We’re seeing what was predicted, which is more extremes of weather.”Mr. Trump got some backing from hundreds of supporters who gathered outside the airport, some of them echoing his point about culling forests to prevent the kind of outbreak consuming the region. “I think they should have been cutting trees” ahead of fire season, said Rachel Moses, 43, of Roseville, Calif., who was wearing a pink Trump hat and brought her two sons with her.Experts say climate change, the management of public lands and decisions over where to site housing all contribute to wildfires. Mr. Trump has exclusively blamed poor forest management and last year issued an executive order directing agencies to cut down more trees, arguing that expanding timber harvesting would reduce forest fires.Image“If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” former Vice President Joseph R.

Research by Mr. Myllyvirta has shown that by May, carbon dioxide emissions from energy production, cement making and other industrial uses were 4 percent higher than the year before. China also granted more construction permits for coal-fired power plants in the first six months of 2020 than it had each year in 2018 and 2019.Mr. Xi, in laying out his country’s plans in a speech at the United Nations, did not detail how China would meet the targets. Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said that the lack of specificity was probably intended to leave the Communist Party leadership flexibility in the short term to pursue an economic rebound following the pandemic.The government’s next five-year plan, to be released soon, will be a key document, detailing the necessary economic, industrial and environmental changes that will be necessary.“They really need to roll up their sleeves from today to capture the level of ambition we heard last night in our daily practices,” Mr. Li said in a telephone interview from Beijing, referring to Mr. Xi’s U.N. speech.The impact could affect all 1.4 billion people in ChinaImageInstalling solar panels on a high-rise in Wuhan in 2018.Credit...Bryan Denton for The New York TimesMr. Li said the carbon neutrality pledge required a complete transformation of the Chinese economy.“Think about it: The way we eat, the way we consume energy, the way we produce our food, the way we commute to work will need to be completely rearranged,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyWhile China clings to industries that are consumers of coal, it has also emerged as a leader in clean energy technologies, including solar panels and wind turbines. It is the world’s largest manufacturer of electric cars and buses. That could leave the government well positioned to make a transition away from fossil fuels, provided the political commitment is there.China could also ramp up its ambitions to build nuclear power plants to replace coal-fired plants, though that would prompt other environmental and safety questions.Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, touted the growth of renewable energy, saying China’s capacity now accounted for 30 percent of the world’s total. Meeting the new goals “reflects China’s willingness to work with other countries to build a vigorous, clean and beautiful world and its responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind,” he said on Wednesday.Mr. Xi has previously pledged to increase government support for new technologies, while doing more to fight pollution, protect natural resources and expand the country’s national park networks.Preserving the Communist Party’s power remains his first priority, but pollution and other environmental threats are increasingly seen as threats to the party’s standing.

While Mr. Xi stopped short of that, his pledges to move the target before 2030 and to set carbon neutrality as a goal for the first time stood in stark contrast to President Trump’s climate skepticism, which was punctuated by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement.Pledging to do more on the climate could at least counterbalance the rising anger China faces in Europe and beyond over its record of oppression in Xinjiang and Tibet, its territorial conflicts in the Himalayas and the South China Sea, military threats toward Taiwan and a sweeping crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy.“The Europeans will be closely watching how serious Xi is, but it was a very clever and well-timed move,” Janka Oertel, director of the Asia Program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said.Claire Fu contributed research.",nytimes,"China’s Pledge to Be Carbon Neutral by 2060: What It Means for the Future of the Climate According to: (1) UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Policy (2020), a resolution endorsed by 27 Member States of the Conference of Parties, adopted in Geneva by 16 September 2014 (2) UN Climate Change Conference Report 2030 (2013), a report of the Committee on the Implementation of its second comprehensive climate negotiations on 2 October 2014, a report of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Policy (UNFCCC)(3) The two Global Alliance Declaration of Sustainable Development, signed by the ECHR (World Equestrian Federation) on 23 June 1975 (the EEA (Eligible Species Agenda) since 1980), have ended their binding commitments to sustainability in accordance with the UNFCCC.

A Climate Center on Governors Island? Could Be a Game Changer,"Rumors of New York’s demise are exaggerated. The other day more than 160 business leaders wrote Mayor Bill de Blasio about “widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality-of-life issues.” The city is in many ways back to life.But City Hall had been running low on leadership and good ideas before the pandemic. New York needs them both now.So it was, in a sense, good news that the nonprofit Trust for Governors Island released a proposal on Monday to rezone disused parts of the island, long set aside for economic redevelopment.It’s an aspirational plan, more than anything. The goal, which has been circulating for a while, is to incubate a new climate research center. Similar ideas have been advanced for decades on Governors Island. There was once talk about a global health center. In 2002, City University of New York was rumored to be contemplating a campus. The governor and mayor talked about renaming the place CUNY Island.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThis time there’s not even a specific tenant in mind, just a desire to attract one. Still, change starts somewhere. The current rezoning proposal begins a city land use review process starting next month.ImageDisused warehouses from the derelict Coast Guard base on Governors Island. Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesI’ve seen renderings by WXY, the excellent New York architecture firm. They’re rosy advertisements for hypothetical construction. But they give a sense of the scale and potential of the concept, which in this case could entail as much as four or five million square feet of new development.According to Clare Newman, the president and chief executive officer of the trust, the prospective climate center would offer public programs, offices for green tech companies and architecture and engineering firms, and be anchored by a university or research institute that would build and pay for its part of the campus.In recent years, Governors Island has become one of the city’s quiet marvels. For several summers, my younger son has attended a kind of “Lord of the Flies” day camp there that’s basically a junk yard with hammers, nails and hands-off instructors. Eight minutes by ferry from Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, the island feels a world apart, a mini 19th century New England village with Adirondack chairs and food carts, smack in the middle of New York Harbor.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Lenape called it Pagganck, or Nut Island. The Continental Army used it to defend against a British naval assault; the Union Army, to imprison captured Confederate officers. Until 1996 it was a Coast Guard base, with barracks, a Burger King and bowling alley. By the time the city and state jointly acquired it from federal authorities (for $1) it was a ghost town, derelict and lacking potable water. The city took sole possession in 2010, with the goal of creating open space, cultural and educational programs and mixed-use development.Leslie Koch, the first president of the trust, oversaw the transformation. Last year nearly a million people from every ZIP code in the city visited. A maritime-themed high school has its home on the island. West 8, the Dutch landscape architecture firm, put together a master plan, which determined where development could go, and converted swaths of open space into spectacular parkland with rolling hills and meadows.The city has invested some $400 million so far. Like Brooklyn Bridge Park and other Bloomberg-era public-private ventures, the understanding has always been that Governors Island should eventually pay for itself. According to Ms. Newman, it still depends on the city to cover about three-fourths of a $20 million annual operating budget. With tax revenues cratering, who knows how long that will last.Of course many universities are also facing a cash crunch because of the pandemic. Not many may be looking to expand at this moment.But history can be useful here. Rockefeller Center broke ground at the start of the Depression; Lincoln Center, when thousands of New Yorkers were fleeing to the suburbs. The obvious precedent to the Governors Island proposal, the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, was hatched during the last recession.ImageYankee Pier now.Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesImageA rendering of what Yankee Pier might look like in the new development.Credit...WXY architecture + urban design/bloomimagesAnd, after all, it was in the wake of 9/11, when doomsayers predicted the end of tall buildings and the abandonment of New York by big businesses, that city leaders plotted an economic turnaround, which precipitated an unprecedented boom in skyscraper construction.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNow the West is ablaze. A Washington Post story this week describes two glaciers in Antarctica whose imminent collapse could raise global sea levels 10 feet. Covid-19, and America’s feeble response to it, dominate the headlines — but what has the pandemic proved if not that apocalyptic threats, man-made or otherwise, require preparedness, coordination, public education and fresh thinking?There’s a clear climate risk to building a climate research center on the waterfront. The trust counters that the island is, in fact, an ideal petri dish and laboratory for climate adaptation. It’s an argument. Part of the ingenuity of West 8’s design was to strategize protections that worked during Hurricane Sandy.Alicia Glen, a former deputy mayor, who now chairs the Governors Island Trust, cites the hopeful case of Robert Moses. Three-quarters of a century ago he helped persuade the United Nations to locate its headquarters in the city. That coup ensured New York would be at the center of the conversation about humanity and survival in the postwar era. It also brought economic development to the city.These days any new development is a call to the barricades for many New Yorkers. Those who love Governors Island as it is now may well ask whether even a do-good project is really necessary. A better question might be: Will whatever gets built there — if anything does — live up to the design standards of the changes so far?In terms of remaining obstacles, the “elephant in the room,” as Ms. Newman, the trust president acknowledged, is transportation. Access to Governors Island is still by irregular ferries. Proposals to extend the No. 1 train line, install a cable car, even build out Lower Manhattan, have all surfaced over the years.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIncreased ferry service to beefed up piers seems the easiest solution. It would require yet another capital outlay by the city.To judge from West 8’s master plan and WXY’s renderings, the good news is that existing parkland can be integrated with mostly low-rise development to preserve open spaces, repurpose historic buildings and turn the island into a kind of green Epcot, with a campus that could serve as both a research hub and a showcase for the latest resilient technologies and materials.Architecturally speaking, everything will come down to the details — and the as-yet-undetermined tenant(s).Meanwhile, here’s hoping the rezoning passes city muster. Planning the future of New York is what we need now. It involves many steps. This is a small but useful one. We need more.",nytimes,"A Climate Center on Governors Island? Could Be a Game Changer on Campus?FDA has been at work on regulations to reverse climate change and put an end to greenhouse gas emissions across the country over the past few decades. But there is more to the issue than regulation at the state and federal levels.To begin with, the federal government will have about $200 million of taxes on ethanol production after 2016. If states have to provide a percentage of an ethanol tax, they won't be able to charge lower gasoline and diesel prices as needed in 2015, since the state will have to cover many of the costs of raising state gas and diesel prices. So, that will ultimately mean that prices and taxes will be raised anyway during that time as well.FDA will still ask states to pay more, but the numbers will probably be pretty good. State governments — including Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi — will have to cut their fuel or fill their tanks, which was a significant impact of their $33 million federal program.It would also help explain why the FCC canceled its upcoming decision to require states to fund transportation, a key component of the program. Gov.

California Plans to Ban Sales of New Gas-Powered Cars in 15 Years,"California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars statewide by 2035, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday, in a sweeping move aimed at accelerating the state’s efforts to combat global warming amid a deadly and record-breaking wildfire season.In an executive order, Governor Newsom directed California’s regulators to develop a plan that would require automakers to sell steadily more zero-emissions passenger vehicles in the state, such as battery-powered or hydrogen-powered cars and pickup trucks, until they make up 100 percent of new auto sales in just 15 years.The plan would also set a goal for all heavy-duty trucks on the road in California to be zero emissions by 2045 where possible. And the order directs the state’s transportation agencies to look for near-term actions to reduce Californian’s reliance on driving by, for example, expanding access to mass transit and biking.“This is the next big global industry,” Governor Newsom said at a news conference on Wednesday, referring to clean-energy technologies such as electric vehicles. “And California wants to dominate it.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCalifornia has long cast itself as a global leader on climate-change policy, having already passed a law to get 100 percent of its electricity from wind, solar and other sources that don’t produce carbon dioxide by 2045.

Last year, only 8 percent of the nearly two million passenger vehicles sold statewide were battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Transportation remains California’s largest source of planet-warming emissions, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the state’s greenhouse gases from human activity.“We have a strategy to be as bold as the problem is big, to recognize that we have agency,” Governor Newsom said at the news conference, where he stood before a glittering half circle of electric cars. “We’re not just victims of fate.”In addition to setting new standards for automakers in the state, California will also likely need to increase financial incentives for people to afford electric vehicles and significantly expand its charging infrastructure, said Don Anair, deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It’s feasible, but it’s going to take California pulling all the levers at its disposal,” Mr. Anair said.The order would affect only new-vehicle sales, the governor’s office said. It would not prevent Californians from owning cars with internal combustion engines past 2035 or selling them on the used-vehicle market.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents most of the nation’s automakers, said it welcomed efforts to expand the electric-vehicle market in California, but questioned whether a ban on internal combustion engines was the best way to achieve that goal.“Neither mandates nor bans build successful markets,” said John Bozzella, the alliance’s chief executive, in a statement. “Much more needs to be done to increase consumer demand for Zero Emission Vehicles in order for California to reach its goals. It will require increased infrastructure, incentives, fleet requirements, building codes, and much more.”The new executive order would build on California’s existing vehicle policies. State regulators have already set a goal of putting five million zero-emissions vehicles on the road by 2030. In June, the state adopted a major rule requiring more than half of all trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035. And regulators are currently working on a rule that could require ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber to shift to electric vehicles.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

Although 15 countries have already announced plans to phase out sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines in the coming decades — including Britain, Denmark and Norway — California would be the first jurisdiction in the United States to do so.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEnvironmental groups had mixed reactions to Governor Newsom’s announcement. While they applauded the new goal for zero-emission vehicles, they noted that California remained one of the country’s largest oil and gas producers, particularly as energy companies have used hydraulic fracturing to unlock new fossil-fuel reserves in recent years.“Setting a timeline to eliminate petroleum vehicles is a big step, but Newsom’s announcement provided rhetoric rather than real action on the other critical half of the climate problem — California’s dirty oil production,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.“Newsom can’t claim climate leadership while handing out permits to oil companies to drill and frack,” Ms. Siegel said.In his news conference, Governor Newsom said he lacked the authority to ban oil and gas drilling in the state on his own. His executive order sets a goal of ending new permits for hydraulic fracturing by 2024, and he said he would work with California’s legislature to set rules that would better protect vulnerable communities from nearby fossil-fuel extraction and help the state’s energy industry transition away from oil and gas.“None of us are naïve. California is a fossil fuel state,” he said. “We need to focus on a just transition.”The oil and gas industry reacted sharply to the order.“Let’s be clear: Today’s announcement to curb in-state production of energy will put thousands of workers in the Central Valley, Los Angeles basin, and Central Coast on the state’s overloaded unemployment program, drive up energy costs when consumers can least afford it, and hurt California’s fight to lower global greenhouse gas emissions,” said Rock Zierman, chief executive of the California Independent Petroleum Association.Asked why he was moving forward with the electric car mandate by executive order rather than asking the legislature to approve it, Governor Newsom cited the example of the state’s new rule requiring all trucks sold in California to be zero-emissions by 2045, which was rolled out by the state’s clean air regulator, the California Air Resources Board.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“This moment demands leadership, it demands movement,” Governor Newsom said, adding that the truck rule is now being replicated in other states.In theory, a future California governor could try to undo Mr. Newsom’s rules, though legal experts said it would be difficult. “Executive orders can always be undone by future governors,” said Cara Horowitz, co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at U.C.L.A. Law School. “But once this reaches the regulatory stage, it’s a lot stickier.”There is one key complication in California’s move: The Trump administration has challenged the state’s authority to set its own pollution standards for cars and trucks as part of its rollback of Obama-era vehicle efficiency rules. California has defended its authority to set its own stricter rules under the 1970 Clean Air Act, but that dispute has yet to be settled by the courts.Mary Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, said on Wednesday that she expected the state to be taken to court over the regulations. “We’ll get there eventually,” she said.",nytimes,"California Plans to Ban Sales of New Gas-Powered Cars in 15 Years (S3E08), Ann Arbor: Michigan Gas & Electric Corporation, 1994.

The Arctic Is Shifting to a New Climate Because of Global Warming,"The effects of global warming in the Arctic are so severe that the region is shifting to a different climate, one characterized less by ice and snow and more by open water and rain, scientists said Monday.Already, they said, sea ice in the Arctic has declined so much that even an extremely cold year would not result in as much ice as was typical decades ago. Two other characteristics of the region’s climate, seasonal air temperatures and the number of days of rain instead of snow, are shifting in the same way, the researchers said.The Arctic is among the parts of the world most influenced by climate change, with sharply rising temperatures, thawing permafrost and other effects in addition to shrinking sea ice. The study, by Laura Landrum and Marika M. Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is an effort to put what is occurring in the region in context.“Everybody knows the Arctic is changing,” said Dr. Landrum, a climate scientist and the lead author of the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “We really wanted to quantify if this is a new climate.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn other words, she said, “has the Arctic changed so much and so fast that the new climate cannot be predicted from the recent past?”Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

This year is expected to be a record or near-record low for ice extent, which will be determined by the end of this month as the summer melt period ends.For fall and winter air temperatures and rain vs. snow days, the simulations found that the transition to a new climate is occurring more slowly, with the shift expected to be complete by the middle of the century.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOverall, Dr. Landrum said, “We are beginning to get to the point where we can no longer know what to expect.”ImageKivalina, Alaska, on the Chukchi Sea, in September 2019.

And determining the timing of the various shifts is an interesting contribution.But scientists have known for a long time that fundamental changes were occurring in the region. “We know what used to be,” Dr. Kay said. “We call it the ‘new Arctic’ because it’s not the same.”Dr. Landrum said that Arctic communities are already suffering from the changes. Eroding coastlines are forcing some Alaska Native villages to consider relocating. Other changes are affecting the food supply. Warmer storms that bring rain on existing snow, for example, can lead to starvation of the animals Indigenous groups rely on.“Arctic climate change is not in the future for them,” she said. “It’s now.”Dr. Landrum said the climate models used in the study simulated the future in a world where planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases remained high. That provides some fodder for optimism, she said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We still have an opportunity to change how rapidly the Arctic evolves,” she said, “if we end up changing our emissions.”“You can’t just give up. If you work hard and make some changes there’s a possibility you’d have some dramatic effects.”Another study released Monday suggested that two Antarctic glaciers that have long been of concern to scientists over their potential to contribute to sea level rise may be in worse shape than previously thought.The Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers are rivers of ice, slowly moving ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in the continent’s interior to the ocean, where it melts and adds to sea level rise. In recent decades the two glaciers’ movement has accelerated, leading to more ice loss from the interior, largely because of melting by warm water underneath the glaciers.Even with the acceleration, however, complete melting of this part of the West Antarctic sheet could take centuries.The new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed satellite imagery and found cracks and other signs of stress damage to the glaciers’ ice shelves, the leading edges that float on the water. This evidence of damage, the paper’s authors wrote, is the first sign of structural weakening of the ice shelves, a process that can end in the shelves’ disintegration and even faster glacial flow of ice to the ocean. The authors said that incorporating these damage processes into models of ice-sheet dynamics is critical for more accurate assessments of potential sea-level rise.",nytimes,"The Arctic Is Shifting to a New Climate Because of Global Warming"".The global mean temperature between 1970 and 2011 dropped by about 1.5°C (5.3°F) compared to over the same period.

A Climate Center on Governors Island? Could Be a Game Changer,"Rumors of New York’s demise are exaggerated. The other day more than 160 business leaders wrote Mayor Bill de Blasio about “widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality-of-life issues.” The city is in many ways back to life.But City Hall had been running low on leadership and good ideas before the pandemic. New York needs them both now.So it was, in a sense, good news that the nonprofit Trust for Governors Island released a proposal on Monday to rezone disused parts of the island, long set aside for economic redevelopment.It’s an aspirational plan, more than anything. The goal, which has been circulating for a while, is to incubate a new climate research center. Similar ideas have been advanced for decades on Governors Island. There was once talk about a global health center. In 2002, City University of New York was rumored to be contemplating a campus. The governor and mayor talked about renaming the place CUNY Island.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThis time there’s not even a specific tenant in mind, just a desire to attract one. Still, change starts somewhere. The current rezoning proposal begins a city land use review process starting next month.ImageDisused warehouses from the derelict Coast Guard base on Governors Island. Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesI’ve seen renderings by WXY, the excellent New York architecture firm. They’re rosy advertisements for hypothetical construction. But they give a sense of the scale and potential of the concept, which in this case could entail as much as four or five million square feet of new development.According to Clare Newman, the president and chief executive officer of the trust, the prospective climate center would offer public programs, offices for green tech companies and architecture and engineering firms, and be anchored by a university or research institute that would build and pay for its part of the campus.In recent years, Governors Island has become one of the city’s quiet marvels. For several summers, my younger son has attended a kind of “Lord of the Flies” day camp there that’s basically a junk yard with hammers, nails and hands-off instructors. Eight minutes by ferry from Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, the island feels a world apart, a mini 19th century New England village with Adirondack chairs and food carts, smack in the middle of New York Harbor.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe Lenape called it Pagganck, or Nut Island. The Continental Army used it to defend against a British naval assault; the Union Army, to imprison captured Confederate officers. Until 1996 it was a Coast Guard base, with barracks, a Burger King and bowling alley. By the time the city and state jointly acquired it from federal authorities (for $1) it was a ghost town, derelict and lacking potable water. The city took sole possession in 2010, with the goal of creating open space, cultural and educational programs and mixed-use development.Leslie Koch, the first president of the trust, oversaw the transformation. Last year nearly a million people from every ZIP code in the city visited. A maritime-themed high school has its home on the island. West 8, the Dutch landscape architecture firm, put together a master plan, which determined where development could go, and converted swaths of open space into spectacular parkland with rolling hills and meadows.The city has invested some $400 million so far. Like Brooklyn Bridge Park and other Bloomberg-era public-private ventures, the understanding has always been that Governors Island should eventually pay for itself. According to Ms. Newman, it still depends on the city to cover about three-fourths of a $20 million annual operating budget. With tax revenues cratering, who knows how long that will last.Of course many universities are also facing a cash crunch because of the pandemic. Not many may be looking to expand at this moment.But history can be useful here. Rockefeller Center broke ground at the start of the Depression; Lincoln Center, when thousands of New Yorkers were fleeing to the suburbs. The obvious precedent to the Governors Island proposal, the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, was hatched during the last recession.ImageYankee Pier now.Credit...George Etheredge for The New York TimesImageA rendering of what Yankee Pier might look like in the new development.Credit...WXY architecture + urban design/bloomimagesAnd, after all, it was in the wake of 9/11, when doomsayers predicted the end of tall buildings and the abandonment of New York by big businesses, that city leaders plotted an economic turnaround, which precipitated an unprecedented boom in skyscraper construction.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNow the West is ablaze. A Washington Post story this week describes two glaciers in Antarctica whose imminent collapse could raise global sea levels 10 feet. Covid-19, and America’s feeble response to it, dominate the headlines — but what has the pandemic proved if not that apocalyptic threats, man-made or otherwise, require preparedness, coordination, public education and fresh thinking?There’s a clear climate risk to building a climate research center on the waterfront. The trust counters that the island is, in fact, an ideal petri dish and laboratory for climate adaptation. It’s an argument. Part of the ingenuity of West 8’s design was to strategize protections that worked during Hurricane Sandy.Alicia Glen, a former deputy mayor, who now chairs the Governors Island Trust, cites the hopeful case of Robert Moses. Three-quarters of a century ago he helped persuade the United Nations to locate its headquarters in the city. That coup ensured New York would be at the center of the conversation about humanity and survival in the postwar era. It also brought economic development to the city.These days any new development is a call to the barricades for many New Yorkers. Those who love Governors Island as it is now may well ask whether even a do-good project is really necessary. A better question might be: Will whatever gets built there — if anything does — live up to the design standards of the changes so far?In terms of remaining obstacles, the “elephant in the room,” as Ms. Newman, the trust president acknowledged, is transportation. Access to Governors Island is still by irregular ferries. Proposals to extend the No. 1 train line, install a cable car, even build out Lower Manhattan, have all surfaced over the years.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIncreased ferry service to beefed up piers seems the easiest solution. It would require yet another capital outlay by the city.To judge from West 8’s master plan and WXY’s renderings, the good news is that existing parkland can be integrated with mostly low-rise development to preserve open spaces, repurpose historic buildings and turn the island into a kind of green Epcot, with a campus that could serve as both a research hub and a showcase for the latest resilient technologies and materials.Architecturally speaking, everything will come down to the details — and the as-yet-undetermined tenant(s).Meanwhile, here’s hoping the rezoning passes city muster. Planning the future of New York is what we need now. It involves many steps. This is a small but useful one. We need more.",nytimes,"A Climate Center on Governors Island? Could Be a Game Changer on Campus?FDA has been at work on regulations to reverse climate change and put an end to greenhouse gas emissions across the country over the past few decades. But there is more to the issue than regulation at the state and federal levels.To begin with, the federal government will have about $200 million of taxes on ethanol production after 2016. If states have to provide a percentage of an ethanol tax, they won't be able to charge lower gasoline and diesel prices as needed in 2015, since the state will have to cover many of the costs of raising state gas and diesel prices. So, that will ultimately mean that prices and taxes will be raised anyway during that time as well.FDA will still ask states to pay more, but the numbers will probably be pretty good. State governments — including Georgia, Arkansas and Mississippi — will have to cut their fuel or fill their tanks, which was a significant impact of their $33 million federal program.It would also help explain why the FCC canceled its upcoming decision to require states to fund transportation, a key component of the program. Gov. Nathan Deal gave the green light to the program with an $889 million budget request, when the state spends about $60 million on it annually.""States need to continue to work with their local governments and in the interest of meeting their cost needs, I wouldn't approve of that.",GPT-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
California Plans to Ban Sales of New Gas-Powered Cars in 15 Years,"California plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars statewide by 2035, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday, in a sweeping move aimed at accelerating the state’s efforts to combat global warming amid a deadly and record-breaking wildfire season.In an executive order, Governor Newsom directed California’s regulators to develop a plan that would require automakers to sell steadily more zero-emissions passenger vehicles in the state, such as battery-powered or hydrogen-powered cars and pickup trucks, until they make up 100 percent of new auto sales in just 15 years.The plan would also set a goal for all heavy-duty trucks on the road in California to be zero emissions by 2045 where possible. And the order directs the state’s transportation agencies to look for near-term actions to reduce Californian’s reliance on driving by, for example, expanding access to mass transit and biking.“This is the next big global industry,” Governor Newsom said at a news conference on Wednesday, referring to clean-energy technologies such as electric vehicles. “And California wants to dominate it.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyCalifornia has long cast itself as a global leader on climate-change policy, having already passed a law to get 100 percent of its electricity from wind, solar and other sources that don’t produce carbon dioxide by 2045. But in recent weeks, as the state has been scorched by record wildfires partly driven by rising temperatures, Governor Newsom has found himself pressured to act even faster.California Today: Follow updates on the wildfires, the pandemic and all the most important issues facing the Golden State.Sign UpJournalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Ramping up sales of emissions-free vehicles in California will be an enormous challenge over a relatively short period of time, experts said. Last year, only 8 percent of the nearly two million passenger vehicles sold statewide were battery-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Transportation remains California’s largest source of planet-warming emissions, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the state’s greenhouse gases from human activity.“We have a strategy to be as bold as the problem is big, to recognize that we have agency,” Governor Newsom said at the news conference, where he stood before a glittering half circle of electric cars. “We’re not just victims of fate.”In addition to setting new standards for automakers in the state, California will also likely need to increase financial incentives for people to afford electric vehicles and significantly expand its charging infrastructure, said Don Anair, deputy director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It’s feasible, but it’s going to take California pulling all the levers at its disposal,” Mr. Anair said.The order would affect only new-vehicle sales, the governor’s office said. It would not prevent Californians from owning cars with internal combustion engines past 2035 or selling them on the used-vehicle market.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents most of the nation’s automakers, said it welcomed efforts to expand the electric-vehicle market in California, but questioned whether a ban on internal combustion engines was the best way to achieve that goal.“Neither mandates nor bans build successful markets,” said John Bozzella, the alliance’s chief executive, in a statement. “Much more needs to be done to increase consumer demand for Zero Emission Vehicles in order for California to reach its goals. It will require increased infrastructure, incentives, fleet requirements, building codes, and much more.”The new executive order would build on California’s existing vehicle policies. State regulators have already set a goal of putting five million zero-emissions vehicles on the road by 2030. In June, the state adopted a major rule requiring more than half of all trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035. And regulators are currently working on a rule that could require ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber to shift to electric vehicles.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on? Get the latest news about climate change, plus tips on how you can help.Sign UpToday’s step would go much further. Although 15 countries have already announced plans to phase out sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines in the coming decades — including Britain, Denmark and Norway — California would be the first jurisdiction in the United States to do so.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyEnvironmental groups had mixed reactions to Governor Newsom’s announcement. While they applauded the new goal for zero-emission vehicles, they noted that California remained one of the country’s largest oil and gas producers, particularly as energy companies have used hydraulic fracturing to unlock new fossil-fuel reserves in recent years.“Setting a timeline to eliminate petroleum vehicles is a big step, but Newsom’s announcement provided rhetoric rather than real action on the other critical half of the climate problem — California’s dirty oil production,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.“Newsom can’t claim climate leadership while handing out permits to oil companies to drill and frack,” Ms. Siegel said.In his news conference, Governor Newsom said he lacked the authority to ban oil and gas drilling in the state on his own. His executive order sets a goal of ending new permits for hydraulic fracturing by 2024, and he said he would work with California’s legislature to set rules that would better protect vulnerable communities from nearby fossil-fuel extraction and help the state’s energy industry transition away from oil and gas.“None of us are naïve. California is a fossil fuel state,” he said. “We need to focus on a just transition.”The oil and gas industry reacted sharply to the order.“Let’s be clear: Today’s announcement to curb in-state production of energy will put thousands of workers in the Central Valley, Los Angeles basin, and Central Coast on the state’s overloaded unemployment program, drive up energy costs when consumers can least afford it, and hurt California’s fight to lower global greenhouse gas emissions,” said Rock Zierman, chief executive of the California Independent Petroleum Association.Asked why he was moving forward with the electric car mandate by executive order rather than asking the legislature to approve it, Governor Newsom cited the example of the state’s new rule requiring all trucks sold in California to be zero-emissions by 2045, which was rolled out by the state’s clean air regulator, the California Air Resources Board.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“This moment demands leadership, it demands movement,” Governor Newsom said, adding that the truck rule is now being replicated in other states.In theory, a future California governor could try to undo Mr. Newsom’s rules, though legal experts said it would be difficult. “Executive orders can always be undone by future governors,” said Cara Horowitz, co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at U.C.L.A. Law School. “But once this reaches the regulatory stage, it’s a lot stickier.”There is one key complication in California’s move: The Trump administration has challenged the state’s authority to set its own pollution standards for cars and trucks as part of its rollback of Obama-era vehicle efficiency rules. California has defended its authority to set its own stricter rules under the 1970 Clean Air Act, but that dispute has yet to be settled by the courts.Mary Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, said on Wednesday that she expected the state to be taken to court over the regulations. “We’ll get there eventually,” she said.",nytimes,"California Plans to Ban Sales of New Gas-Powered Cars in 15 Years (S3E08), Ann Arbor: Michigan Gas & Electric Corporation, 1994.

The Arctic Is Shifting to a New Climate Because of Global Warming,"The effects of global warming in the Arctic are so severe that the region is shifting to a different climate, one characterized less by ice and snow and more by open water and rain, scientists said Monday.Already, they said, sea ice in the Arctic has declined so much that even an extremely cold year would not result in as much ice as was typical decades ago. Two other characteristics of the region’s climate, seasonal air temperatures and the number of days of rain instead of snow, are shifting in the same way, the researchers said.The Arctic is among the parts of the world most influenced by climate change, with sharply rising temperatures, thawing permafrost and other effects in addition to shrinking sea ice. The study, by Laura Landrum and Marika M. Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., is an effort to put what is occurring in the region in context.“Everybody knows the Arctic is changing,” said Dr. Landrum, a climate scientist and the lead author of the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “We really wanted to quantify if this is a new climate.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn other words, she said, “has the Arctic changed so much and so fast that the new climate cannot be predicted from the recent past?”Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on?

This year is expected to be a record or near-record low for ice extent, which will be determined by the end of this month as the summer melt period ends.For fall and winter air temperatures and rain vs. snow days, the simulations found that the transition to a new climate is occurring more slowly, with the shift expected to be complete by the middle of the century.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyOverall, Dr. Landrum said, “We are beginning to get to the point where we can no longer know what to expect.”ImageKivalina, Alaska, on the Chukchi Sea, in September 2019.

And determining the timing of the various shifts is an interesting contribution.But scientists have known for a long time that fundamental changes were occurring in the region. “We know what used to be,” Dr. Kay said. “We call it the ‘new Arctic’ because it’s not the same.”Dr. Landrum said that Arctic communities are already suffering from the changes. Eroding coastlines are forcing some Alaska Native villages to consider relocating. Other changes are affecting the food supply. Warmer storms that bring rain on existing snow, for example, can lead to starvation of the animals Indigenous groups rely on.“Arctic climate change is not in the future for them,” she said. “It’s now.”Dr. Landrum said the climate models used in the study simulated the future in a world where planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases remained high. That provides some fodder for optimism, she said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“We still have an opportunity to change how rapidly the Arctic evolves,” she said, “if we end up changing our emissions.”“You can’t just give up.

"Arctic Sea Ice Reaches a Low, Just Missing Record","A “crazy year” in the Arctic has resulted in the second-lowest extent of sea ice in the region, scientists said Monday.Researchers with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said the minimum was most likely reached on Sept. 15, with 1.44 million square miles of ocean covered in ice. Since then, with temperatures falling and new ice forming, coverage has been increasing.Since satellite measurements of sea ice began four decades ago, only 2012 has had a lower minimum, when 1.32 million square miles were measured. The 2020 minimum was nearly a million square miles less than the average annual minimum between 1981 and 2010.This year also continues an alarming streak: The 14 lowest ice years have occurred in the past 14 years. Many scientists expect that the Arctic could be devoid of ice in summers well before midcentury.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“It’s been a crazy year up north, with sea ice at a near-record low, 100-degree heat waves in Siberia, and massive forest fires,” Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said in a statement. “We are headed towards a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, and this year is another nail in the coffin.”Arctic sea ice grows to its maximum extent during fall and winter and then melts during spring and summer.

The region is warming more than twice as fast as any other.Sea ice loss plays a role in this rapid warming. Ice reflects most of the sunlight that strikes it. But when it melts, more ocean is exposed. The ocean surface is darker and absorbs more of the sun’s rays, re-emitting the energy as heat.

Large parts of the region was mostly still settled, and virtually none of the ice that covered the land was broken. The New York Times noted that from 1971 to 2007, the Arctic ice is melting as fast as it has since the great ice age. Over the rest of the Arctic Circle, the ice has dropped by more than five feet (7 meters) and returned to its preindustrial levels. The impact has not yet ceased at sea level—at least not in this case. Temperatures have gone well below freezing. The Arctic sea ice coverage in the New York Times report is close to the 30 or so feet (3 meter) or the 300 feet (110 meter) record set by the Los Angeles Times back in 2001.

A Trump-Biden Split Screen on Climate,"[Follow our live coverage of the 2020 election between President Trump and Joe Biden.]As Trump continues to deny climate science, Biden says such remarks fit a pattern: “We’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America.” It’s Tuesday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.ImageWhere things standEven as he bore witness firsthand to the devastation caused by wildfires during a visit to California yesterday, President Trump continued to defiantly ignore the science of climate change.Speaking to reporters, he blamed local officials for failing to contain the blazes, and for not clearing fallen leaves from forests. “When trees fall down after a short period of time, they become very dry — really like a matchstick,” Trump told reporters at the Sacramento airport. “And they can explode. Also leaves. When you have dried leaves on the ground, it’s just fuel for the fires.”When asked about the role of climate change, he was dismissive at first. He passed the question on to Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who said he did believe the scientific consensus. (He also reminded Trump that 57 percent of land in California is made up of federal forests, which are technically under the president’s control.)But later, Trump did not hold back, saying explicitly that he continued to disbelieve the established science on global warming. “It will start getting cooler,” he said. “Just watch. I don’t think science knows, actually.” That statement was in line with Trump’s long history of public comments and official policies calling into question the legitimacy of climate science.Joe Biden gave a speech in Delaware yesterday bashing the president as a “climate arsonist,” while directly appealing to suburban voters. “If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” he asked. “How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms?”That language reflected an apparent bet from Biden’s team that suburban voters will be turned off by the president’s hostility to science — particularly in the midst of a pandemic during which Trump has often been at odds with his own health and science advisers.Eighty-four percent of suburbanites said in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll last month that they generally trusted public health experts to provide accurate information on the coronavirus, considerably more than people living in other areas. And just 23 percent of suburbanites said they trusted Trump’s statements on the virus, the poll found — the lowest of any geographic group.Biden ultimately tied together the coronavirus and the wildfires with the economy and the unrest in American cities. He used all of these issues to illustrate an argument that seemed almost lifted from Trump’s playbook: Under the current president, Biden argued, Americans are simply not safe.“He fails to protect us from the pandemic, from an economic free fall, from racial unrest, from the ravages of climate change,” Biden said. “It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America.”The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled yesterday that Howie Hawkins, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, will not appear on the general election ballot. The 4-to-3 decision clears the way for state election officials to proceed as planned with mail voting, which is set to begin in days. The state plans to send out more mail ballots than in any previous election.If the court had ruled in favor of Hawkins — whose legal effort was aided by a conservative law firm, with Republicans eager to see him siphon votes away from Biden in November — officials would have had to reprint thousands of ballots and send them out again.The court said that Hawkins and his running mate, Angela Walker, had waited too long to appeal a decision from the Wisconsin Elections Commission denying them ballot access because of a discrepancy in Walker’s address on their petitions.In Ohio, those who vote absentee will have to pay their own postage, after a Republican state panel denied the secretary of state’s request for up to $3 million to prepay for stamps. More than a million voters have filed applications for absentee ballots in Ohio so far.“Today was another missed opportunity by the legislature to make a small change, without an impact on our state budget, that would yield a big improvement,” said Frank LaRose, the secretary of state, a Republican.The mayors of 10 U.S. cities published an open letter yesterday calling on Trump to condemn the right-wing vigilantes who have violently clashed with protesters against racial injustice this summer.“We’ve seen an alarming number of fellow elected officials, including yourself, applauding armed intimidation of peaceful protesters,” the letter reads. “We are calling for an end to this dangerous rhetoric. Instead of inciting vigilantism, we urge you to join us in condemning reckless escalations by militias and other extremists.”All of the signatories are members of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an arm of Michael Bloomberg’s gun-control group, Everytown for Gun Safety.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyPhoto of the dayImageCredit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesJoe Biden spoke yesterday outside the Delaware Museum of Natural History in Wilmington.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Is Nevada in play?

The survey offered plenty of indicators that the landscape there could be favorable to Trump this time around, particularly among the white residents who make up roughly three in five Nevada voters.Trump held a rally on Sunday at a manufacturing plant in Henderson, Nev., defying a state order against indoor gatherings of more than 50 people, after the state’s Democratic governor turned down requests to hold the event at outdoor locations. It was the president’s first indoor rally since June.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut this week Trump’s campaign pulled all of its TV advertising in Nevada, investing instead in a range of other states — a reflection of its cash crunch.

The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is flush with money, and has bought ads in both the Las Vegas and Reno markets.Sign up to receive our On Politics newsletter, a daily guide to the political news cycle.Sign UpAs Jennifer Medina reports in an article out today, Nevada’s Democratic machine has established a strong track record over the past dozen years, winning most statewide elections through hard-fought campaigns that have centered on door-knocking and face-to-face contact — particularly with Black and Hispanic voters.But amid the pandemic, that kind of campaigning is harder to do, and Democrats have less than half the number of canvassers on the ground in Nevada than they did in September 2016. Some Democratic officials worry that Trump could flip the state red on the strength of white voters in rural areas.Indeed, the Times/Siena poll showed that Trump’s message might be resonating with those voters in particular. The president led Biden by 11 points among white likely voters in Nevada, a better showing than with white voters in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Minnesota — the three other swing states surveyed in that poll. By nearly two to one, white voters in Nevada said they considered addressing law and order to be a more pressing electoral issue than confronting the coronavirus crisis.Another sign of danger for Biden: his vulnerability with Hispanic voters, who are crucial to any Democratic victory there. Biden won just 17 percent of Latino support in the Nevada caucuses, with 50 percent caucusing for Senator Bernie Sanders, according to entrance polls. Nationwide, recent polls have generally shown Biden lagging behind Clinton’s level of Hispanic support in 2016.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyNew York Times EventsThe evolving electorate: The Gen Z and millennial voteCan young voters get excited about the election if they aren’t excited about the candidates?

"In Visiting a Charred California, Trump Confronts a Scientific Reality He Denies","WASHINGTON — When President Trump flies to California on Monday to assess the state’s raging forest fires, he will come face to face with the grim consequences of a reality he has stubbornly refused to accept: the devastating effects of a warming planet.To the global scientific community, the acres of scorched earth and ash-filled skies across the American West are the tragic, but predictable, result of accelerating climate change. Nearly two years ago, federal government scientists concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels could triple the frequency of severe fires across the Western states.But the president has used his time in the nation’s highest office to aggressively promote the burning of fossil fuels, chiefly by rolling back or weakening every major federal policy intended to combat dangerous emissions. At the same time, Mr. Trump and his senior environmental officials have regularly mocked, denied or minimized the established science of human-caused climate change.Now, as he battles for a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump has doubled down on his anti-climate agenda as a way of appealing to his core supporters. At a rally in Pennsylvania last month, he blamed California’s failure to “clean your floors” of leaves, threatening to “make them pay for it because they don’t listen to us.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe lethal fires spreading across the West — like the coronavirus that has ravaged the country for months — are a warning for the president that many voters may hold him and his administration accountable for brushing aside scientific experts and failing to effectively mobilize the government to minimize natural disasters that have claimed lives, damaged property and threatened economic prosperity.“Talk to a firefighter if you think that climate change isn’t real,” Mayor Eric M. Garcetti of Los Angeles, a supporter of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It seems like this administration are the last vestiges of the Flat Earth Society of this generation.”Mr. Trump’s climate record is far more aggressive than the laissez-faire environmental policy promoted for years by business interests in his party. Indeed, as he has sought to zealously roll back regulations, even some of the world’s largest oil companies and automakers have opposed the moves, saying that they will lead to years of legal uncertainty that could actually harm their bottom lines.“As an historic figure, he is one of the most culpable men in America contributing to the suffering and death that is now occurring through climate-related tragedy,” Jerry Brown, the former California governor who made climate change his signature issue, said in an interview on Sunday, though he was careful not to blame Mr. Trump specifically for the fires ravaging his state.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe president’s record is also more consequential, experts say, because the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere has now passed the point at which scientists say it would be possible to avert many of the worst effects of global warming — even if tough emissions policies are later enacted.Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign is hoping to use Mr. Trump’s climate positions as a cudgel against him with independents and moderate Republicans. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican former governor of New Jersey, is backing Mr. Biden’s candidacy in large part because of the president’s environmental policies.“It’s mind-boggling, the ignorance that he displays on this subject,” Ms. Whitman said in an interview on Sunday. “He doesn’t understand climate change. He doesn’t particularly believe in science. It’s all about him and his re-election.”“He doesn’t govern for all Americans,” she said.On Saturday, Mr. Trump abruptly added the trip to McClellan Park, Calif., near Sacramento, to be briefed on the fires to an already scheduled West Coast fund-raising and campaign swing. He had come under intense criticism for weeks of silence on the increasingly deadly blazes that are consuming parts of California, Oregon and Washington — three Democratic-led states that he has feuded with for years.White House officials noted that Mr. Trump had signed an executive order in 2018 to minimize the risk of wildfires and urged California and other states to improve forest management.“Other countries around the world are obsessed with the Paris climate accord, which shackles economies and has done nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and those on the radical left are pushing the Green New Deal, which would outlaw cows, cars and planes,” said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. He said Mr. Trump had put in place “common sense policies that have kept our air, water and environment clean.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut the president has often treated climate change and the environment as a deeply partisan issue, not unlike his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the recent racial upheaval in some cities, in which he has frequently lashed out at Democratic officials while praising the actions of Republicans.ImageHelicopters dropping water above Santa Anita Canyon in Arcadia, Calif., while battling the Bobcat Fire on Sunday.Credit...Eric Thayer for The New York TimesIn Florida last week, Mr. Trump extended a ban on offshore oil drilling supported by the Republican governor in a key election-year state, even though he has refused to do the same for Democratic-led states in the Northeast.At the event in front of supporters in Jupiter, Fla., Mr. Trump declared himself “a great environmentalist.”In fact, Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the science of climate change since long before he ran for president. In 2012, he tweeted: “In the 1920’s people were worried about global cooling — it never happened. Now it’s global warming. Give me a break!” He also tweeted that the concept of climate change “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”The president has continued to take a dim view of climate science throughout his tenure, even as the government he oversees has reinforced the accepted threats to the future of the planet.In 2017 and 2018, the federal government published a sweeping, two-volume scientific report, the National Climate Assessment, that represents the most authoritative and comprehensive conclusions to date about the causes and effects of climate change in the United States.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe report is clear about the causes — burning fossil fuels — and the effects: It found that the increased drought, flooding, storms and worsening wildfires caused by the warming planet could shrink the American economy by up to 10 percent by the end of the century.Two days before the White House published the 2018 volume of that report, Mr. Trump mockingly tweeted, “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS — Whatever happened to Global Warming?”In an interview a month before, he said of global warming, “I don’t know that it’s man-made,” and suggested that even as the planet warmed, “it will change back again” — an idea scientists have long debunked.Mr. Trump has also stocked his administration with senior officials who have openly questioned the basic science of climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which conducts scientific research on climate change, this year hired as a deputy assistant secretary David Legates, a scientist at the University of Delaware who has questioned human-caused global warming. The hiring of Mr. Legates was first reported by NPR.William Happer, a former senior White House adviser and a Princeton physicist who had gained notoriety in the scientific community for statements that carbon dioxide was beneficial to humanity, began an effort last year to ensure that the next National Climate Assessment did not include worst-case scenarios. Although Mr. Happer left the White House last year, that effort is continuing, according to three people familiar with the matter.And Mr. Trump’s first appointee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, declared early in his tenure that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, a statement starkly at odds with the scientific consensus.“It’s interesting to draw the parallels between Covid and climate change,” said Philip B. Duffy, the president of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, who served on the National Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed the National Climate Assessment. “In both of those cases, Trump personally has refused to recognize the threat.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“In both cases, there is no plan to deal with crisis,” he added.Moreover, Mr. Trump has steadily dismantled the climate change plan that was already in place by effectively gutting the federal government’s authority to do anything to lower greenhouse gas pollution.“We had at the end of the Obama administration the first-ever federalwide regulatory regime on climate,” said David G. Victor, the director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego. “Most of that, the Trump administration has actively rolled back.”In his first months in office, Mr. Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which nearly every country in the world had pledged to reduce emissions of planet-warming pollution.Domestically, Mr. Trump directed Andrew Wheeler, the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to dismantle a suite of major climate change regulations put in place by the Obama administration, which had been designed to target pollution from the nation’s three largest sources of greenhouse emissions: coal-fired power plants, auto tailpipes and oil and gas drilling sites. Taken together, those rules represented the country’s first significant step toward reducing greenhouse gases, while putting the world’s largest economy at the forefront of the global effort to fight climate change.Now they are in shambles.In August, the E.P.A. completed the legal process of rolling back rules on methane, a powerful climate-warming gas emitted from leaks and flares in oil and gas wells. In April, it completed its rollback of the rules on tailpipe greenhouse pollution. And in June 2019, it replaced the Obama-era rule requiring coal plants to reduce emissions with a new rule devised to allow the plants to continue to release far more pollution.If Mr. Biden is elected, he has vowed to rejoin the Paris agreement and reinstate those rules, while pushing to enact even stronger policies, spending up to $2 trillion to promote the development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.But experts said it may take far more than that to rebuild the American climate change legacy — or its ability to persuade other governments to take similar action. That is a profound consequence, the experts said, because climate change is a global problem and cannot be meaningfully mitigated unless the world’s largest polluters all work in concert.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The really big effect of what Trump has done is to send a message to the rest of the world that the United States is not credible on climate change,” said Mr. Victor of the University of California, San Diego. “The rest of the world is not going to know if we’re serious because we keep swinging back and forth.”“Over the past 50 years, the effectiveness in creating international deals came from U.S. leadership,” he added. “And now nobody knows if we’re going to do that anymore.”Adam Nagourney contributed reporting from Los Angeles.",nytimes,"In Visiting a Charred California, Trump Confronts a Scientific Reality He Denies on CampusLast month, Trump once again branded climate change a hoax perpetrated on a California State University, Berkeley campus, in an interview with CNN. He claimed that California's massive oil and gas industry is getting the job done, so there's little doubt that oil and gas production has accelerated over the last three decades as climate change forces scientists to dig deeper into a fundamental climate change.If an oil and gas industry was getting those jobs, then, of course, all of this would be confirmed. This was the same Trump who said he was now confident climate change is on the rise because of the Obama Administration's ""man-made"" science. His campaign made no mention of whether Obama's EPA goals would meet the climate change science mandated by the Paris Agreement. Similarly, Trump has repeatedly criticized climate change — at least in his favor — as a ""hoax.""In his first tweet of the day, Trump denounced Russia's alleged role in the hack of Democratic Party data, as well as CNN's coverage of the leak. ""It seems like Russia might just be the top leak on the DNC,"" Trump said, raising eyebrows when asked if Russia was the ""head of the DNC.""

A New Front in the Biden-Trump Battle for the Suburbs: Wildfires,"LOS ANGELES — The explosion of wildfires across the West has opened a new battleground in the critical competition for suburban voters between President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., with growing evidence that climate change is an acute concern for many Americans, particularly women, viewing the nightly images of destruction and thick blankets of acrid air.Mr. Trump has sought to combat his sharp decline among suburban voters by asserting that Democratic control of the White House would be a threat to the safety of the suburbs, raising the specter of crime, rioting and an “invasion” of low-income housing that many view as seeking to stoke racist fears.But Mr. Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, is seeking to redefine what “safety” means for an electorate swept by fear amid a pandemic, social unrest in the streets and now deadly wildfires. He is casting climate change as a more real and immediate threat to the suburbs than the violence portrayed in Mr. Trump’s ads and public remarks, seizing in a speech on Monday on the devastating fires ripping through forests, destroying homes and taking lives.“It’s particularly tangible for people right now,” said Kate Bedingfield, Mr. Biden’s deputy campaign manager.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMr. Biden’s speech came as Mr. Trump paid a last-minute trip to California to meet with officials struggling with the catastrophe, and disputed their assertion that there was any connection between the fires sweeping the state and climate change.The developments suggest that an issue that has always been on the sidelines in national presidential campaigns — and had seemed eclipsed this time by the pandemic and social unrest — may be coming to the forefront with only seven weeks until Election Day.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.For at least some suburban voters, particularly those who live in the West, the threat of losing their homes to fire or the health risks to their families of skies clouded with smoke seem more immediate than the social unrest spotlighted by Mr. Trump in his speeches and advertisements.“We’re not seeing changes in crime,” said Representative Katie Porter of California, a Democrat who represents a once solidly Republican district in Orange County. “People are trying to stay home, trying to stay safe.”More broadly, the fires in the West — and Mr. Trump’s “it’ll start getting cooler, you just watch” disparagement of climate science during his visit to California — have reinforced the perception of the president as anti-science, particularly after his open skepticism toward experts advising him to act more aggressively against the Covid-19 pandemic.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“Those fires in the West are obviously blue states and most of the country is not experiencing it,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. “But it is a reminder for a lot of people — especially for these better educated suburban voters who he thought would react to law and order — of how he is against science.”ImagePresident Trump paid a last-minute trip to California to meet with officials struggling with the catastrophe.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesRob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist critical of Mr. Trump, said the swing suburban voters who delivered Democrats the House of Representatives in 2018 were “repulsed by the way the president talks about climate” specifically and science generally.“I don’t think these suburban voters are going to become climate change voters in 2020,” Mr. Stutzman said, “but the discussion around all of this highlights this Trump Neanderthalism that is offensive to them.”The importance of the battle was underscored again on Tuesday as Senator Kamala Harris, Mr. Biden’s running mate, returned to assess the damage to her home state, meeting with Gov. Gavin Newsom near Fresno and examining the rubble of a home and a school playground destroyed in the Creek Fire.The wildfires have helped to illustrate a critical difference between the Trump White House and a potential Biden presidency. And Mr. Biden signaled what is emerging as a pivotal competition — to define the biggest looming threats to the nation, and particularly to people living in the suburbs — as the candidates approach three debates.“Donald Trump warns that integration is threatening our suburbs. That’s ridiculous,” Mr. Biden said on Monday. “But you know what’s actually threatening our suburbs? Wildfires are burning the suburbs in the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coasts.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn an election in which the gender gap was already a severe problem for the president — with polls showing women supporting Mr. Biden in far greater numbers than men — a renewed focus on climate could prove politically problematic for Mr. Trump’s efforts to win over a voting bloc he memorably has labeled “the ‘suburban housewife.’”“Women are much more concerned than men,” said Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. “The one holdout group in American not concerned about climate change are conservative white men.”In a survey earlier this year, the Pew Research Center found Republican women were more supportive of addressing climate change than their male counterparts. For instance, 47 percent of Republican women said the government was doing too little to protect air quality, compared with only 32 percent of Republican men. There were similar splits on addressing water quality, emissions restrictions on power plants and tougher fuel-efficiency standards.“To the extent there is a swing vote in this election, it’s a lot of Republican-leaning women, many of whom are in the suburbs,” said John D. Podesta, a top adviser to former President Barack Obama on climate change who also served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. “And this is an issue they care about.”Another Pew poll released last month showed 69 percent of people in the suburbs said climate change would be at least somewhat important in determining their 2020 vote, with 41 percent calling it very important.ImageJoseph R. Biden Jr. focused on the dramatic images of fires ripping through forests and destroying homes in a speech on Monday.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York TimesThe fires and the hazardous air they have produced have so far been concentrated in Democratic parts of the nation, and, with the exception of Arizona, are not highlighted on the campaign battleground maps in the Biden and Trump headquarters.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut Mr. Biden’s advisers, as well as environmentalists who have watched in frustration for years as their issues were relegated to the back of a drawer, believe that the sheer destruction of the fires has further elevated this into a powerful issue.That is especially true in a season of hurricanes, dramatic temperature fluctuations and wild weather in other parts of the country. As the fires raged, the Gulf Coast was preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Sally and the torrential rains and flooding it would bring.Mr. Biden has notably framed climate change as one of four simultaneous crises facing the nation, along with the pandemic, the economic downturn and the reckoning over race and policing.“For the first time, the average American is likely to see climate change as a here, now, us problem,” said Mr. Maibach, who studies public opinion on the environment.“They saw it as a distant problem,” Mr. Maibach said of voters previously. “Distant in time — maybe 2100 but not today. Distant in space — maybe Bangladesh and not Boston. And distant in species — polar bears, for sure, but not people.”The climate change debate reflects what has been another critical difference between these two candidates: The value they placed on science-based data. Once again, as with the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr. Trump is denying the assertions of scientists as he seeks to minimize a threat to the nation’s well-being.That emphasis could face a backlash among suburban voters: 84 percent of suburbanites said in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll last month that they trusted public health experts to provide accurate information on the coronavirus, considerably more than people living in other areas. And just 23 percent of suburbanites said they trusted Mr. Trump’s statements on the virus, the lowest of any geographic group.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyMs. Porter, who is one of the freshman suburban Democrats elected in 2018, said that she had seen a huge change in the political environment since Mr. Trump was elected president.“You now need to explicitly address climate change,” she said. “And this is an important change from like four years ago.”Mr. Podesta argued that while Mr. Trump has sought to turn climate change into a “culture war issue of the elite versus regular people” — by linking Mr. Biden to aggressive policy proposals like the Green New Deal — that has backfired in the face of the raging wildfires.“Guess what,"" Mr. Podesta said, “the regular people are fleeing for their lives in Oregon.”Adam Nagourney reported from Los Angeles and Shane Goldmacher from New York.

Trump Administration Releases Plan to Open Tongass Forest to Logging,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday finalized its plan to open about nine million acres of the pristine woodlands of Alaska’s Tongass National Forest to logging and road construction.The administration’s effort to open the Tongass, the nation’s largest national forest, has been in the works for about two years, and the final steps to complete the process have been widely expected for months. They come after years of prodding by successive Alaska governors and congressional delegations, which have pushed the federal government to exempt the Tongass from a Clinton-era policy known as the roadless rule, which banned logging and road construction in much of the national forest system.The United States Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, on Friday published an environmental study concluding that lifting the roadless rule protections in the Tongass would not significantly harm the environment. That study will allow the agency to formally lift the rule in the Tongass within the next 30 days, clearing the way for the Trump administration to propose timber sales and road construction projects in the forest as soon as the end of this year.In a 2019 draft of the study, the Forest Service said it would consider six possible changes to the rule. One option would have maintained restrictions in 80 percent of the area currently protected by the rule; another would have opened up about 2.3 million acres to logging and construction. In a statement released Thursday night, the Department of Agriculture said that its “preferred alternative” is to “fully exempt the Tongass National Forest from the 2001 Roadless Rule,” which would open the nine million acres to development.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe move comes as President Trump wraps up a first term in which he aggressively targeted environmental protections, rolling back or weakening more than 100 regulations that had been designed to protect the nation’s air, water and public lands from pollution. But like many of those rollbacks, the protections to the Tongass could be fairly easily reinstated if former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wins the presidential election.Supporters in Alaska said have long said that lifting the roadless rule protections in their state would provide a sorely needed economic boost. Environmentalists say that it could devastate a vast wilderness of snowy peaks, rushing rivers and virgin old-growth forest that is widely viewed as one of America’s treasures.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Climate Fwd: What on earth is going on? Get the latest news about climate change, plus tips on how you can help.Sign UpClimate scientists also point out that the Tongass, which is also one of the world’s largest temperate rain forests, offers an important service to the billions of people across the planet who are unlikely to ever set foot there: It is one of the world’s largest carbon sinks, storing the equivalent of about 8 percent of the carbon stored in all the forests of the lower 48 states combined.Scientists have criticized the Forest Service’s assessment that lifting the roadless rule would not cause significant environmental harm, saying that it disregards the agency’s own scientific findings that cutting down trees in the Tongass would release harmful amounts of greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere at a time when the warming planet is already fueling deadly wildfires, storms and heat waves.AdvertisementContinue reading the main story“The Forest Service’s environmental impact statement is junk science on assessing the impacts of releasing the carbon,” said Dominick DellaSala, a scientist with the Earth Island Institute, a nonprofit environmental organization. “They are saying that the carbon that would be released by logging the timber is insignificant,” he said. “There’s no science that supports their analysis.”Mr. DellaSala has calculated that the carbon dioxide emissions from logging the 160,000 acres of old-growth forest in the Tongass that would now be open to the timber industry would create the equivalent of adding about 10 million cars to the road.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who has urged Mr. Trump to lift the rule, contends that removing the roadless protections would help Alaska’s economy, but not necessarily lead to the loss of major swaths of the forest. In a 2019 opinion article in The Washington Post, she wrote, “The one-size-fits-all roadless rule is an unnecessary layer of paralyzing regulation that should never have been applied to Alaska,” adding that it hurts the timber industry but “also affects mining, transportation, energy and more.”She also said that “lifting the roadless rule would not automatically result in the development of more of the forest.” Lifting the rule, she said, would not affect the entire forest but would open about nine million of the forest’s 16 million acres. The rest of the land would remain protected under other state and federal statutes.Environmentalists said the devastation to the forest could still be consequential.“Make no mistake,” said Adam Kolton, executive director of Alaska Wilderness League, an advocacy group. “This is about gutting protections for the largest carbon sink and the most biologically rich national forest in the United States. This is America’s Amazon.”Mr. Kolton noted that the opening of the Tongass to development comes as part of a broader push by Mr. Trump to lift longstanding protections across Alaska’s wilderness. The administration has also opened up the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, and this year proposed to open almost all of the National Petroleum Reserve, far to the west of the refuge, to additional drilling.“They are places that sit at the center of three big crises our country is facing — the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis and racial justice,” said Mr. Kolton, noting that Alaska Native tribes living in those areas have also opposed the developments.The administration had until last month been moving swiftly to grant a permit to Pebble Mine, a vast proposed gold and copper extraction facility, until the president’s son Donald J. Trump Jr. publicly opposed it. Last month the administration imposed new conditions on that project which could delay the permit until after the election.",nytimes,"Trump Administration Releases Plan to Open Tongass Forest to Logging onThe Bureau of Land Management is preparing to open a sacred sanctuary for the so-called sacred savages in the Tongass Forest over the next few years, according to documents posted by the agency's website.""The land has been zoned for a long time for mining, trapping, mining on its own, and there would be logging in a variety of ways,"" a BLM official writes in the early May filing from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality and Performance.

We’ll Have to Learn to Live With Smoke. Here’s Why.,"PORTLAND, Ore. — For a full week this month, my family did not leave our house here in this famously outdoorsy city. At times, smoke from the state’s huge wildfires made it hard to see to the end of the block. Sometimes, we could barely see across the street.The smoke was extreme, yes. But it was also a glimpse of the future. “We’re not going to get off of this wildfire train anytime soon,” said Jennifer Balch, a fire scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “The big question is, how do we want our smoke?”Once upon a time, smoke was simply part of life in the West. Many ecosystems evolved to tolerate and even depend on fire, which occurred regularly because of lightning, Native American burning practices, and later, settlers. These blazes were often small. In the early 20th century, however, the U.S. government resolved to stamp out wildfires. And for a while, it succeeded, ushering the country through decades of anomalously fire-free, smoke-free summers.Now, that legacy of suppression has created a fire debt that must be paid back — with interest, because of climate change. And that means learning to live with smoke again. “We’re going to have to accept that you are going to have seasonal smoke in the same way that you may have seasonal allergies,” said Stephen Pyne, an environmental historian and emeritus professor at Arizona State University.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyScientists say that warmer, drier conditions will continue to fuel uncontrolled fires like the recent conflagrations that erupted across the West, producing dangerous palls of intense smoke. However, Dr. Balch and others said they hoped these catastrophes would build public support for a different kind of fire: controlled burning that simulates natural processes and reduces the risk of megafires.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.So-called prescribed fires also generate smoke, but at much lower levels and usually in the spring and late fall. Fire managers also try to conduct burns on days when weather conditions limit smoke exposure. The practice is common in the southeastern United States, but, elsewhere, the anti-fire messages of Smokey Bear still prevail, said John Bailey, a fire expert at Oregon State University. “We’ve just been over-indoctrinated,” he said.Any kind of fire carries some risks, and on rare occasions, prescribed burns have gotten out of control. But catching a whiff of smoke shouldn’t inherently inspire fear, Dr. Bailey said. It could also make people feel “relief that we are managing the fuels and managing the risk rather than waiting to be victim.”That mentality already exists among members of the Yurok tribe in California, which has a long tradition of managing the land with fire. When people drive past controlled burns, they honk their horns in appreciation, said Margo Robbins, the executive director of the Cultural Fire Management Council, a nonprofit group. “They stop and tell us how glad that they are that we are doing this.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyClimate Fwd: What on earth is going on? Get the latest news about climate change, plus tips on how you can help.Sign UpStill, wider use of prescribed fire could extend the smoke season in many places, and researchers don’t fully understand how the health impacts of prolonged, low-level exposure compare to those from short, high doses of pollution.Medical experts do know that there is no safe level of smoke, which causes a litany of respiratory, cardiovascular and other health problems. And that means society will have to adapt.For many, life could look a bit like it has in the Pacific Northwest these last few weeks: hunkering inside on the worst days with doors and windows sealed, running air-conditioners and purifiers. When venturing out, masks may become routine, “the same way we wear glasses or hearing aids,” Dr. Pyne said.Dr. Bailey said he suspected that some residents might even undertake seasonal migrations — “smoke birds” instead of “snow birds.”Those strategies may work for people with flexible jobs, well-built houses, and extra income. But “we should be thinking about those who don’t have the means to do that,” said Colleen Reid, a health geographer and environmental epidemiologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder.Fire scientists agree on the need for accurate long-range smoke forecasting and robust warning systems to alert the public to risks. In some places, including in the South, residents already receive advance notice about prescribed fires through social media, list serves, or fliers left on doors, said Jennifer Fawcett, an extension associate at North Carolina State University.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn non-pandemic times, clean-air shelters offer relief for people with drafty homes and those with no shelter at all. In the long run, though, buildings and houses should be designed or retrofitted to keep smoke out and filter whatever gets in, Dr. Bailey said.As with Covid, essential workers face the greatest threats from smoke, and many have underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable, Dr. Reid said. To protect them, governments may have to consider steps like prohibiting outdoor work, such as harvesting, on the most dangerous days, she said.Dr. Pyne said that learning to live with smoke called for even more change, like reining in industrial sources of air pollution. “That would create some space for fire and smoke where we want it,” he said.After all, smoke has a place in the West. “It’s not that smoke is intrinsically bad any more than fire is intrinsically bad. It’s how it interacts with how we live,” he said. “And part of that problem is deciding, are we living in a way that makes sense?”",nytimes,"We’ll Have to Learn to Live With Smoke.

In a 2019 opinion article in The Washington Post, she wrote, “The one-size-fits-all roadless rule is an unnecessary layer of paralyzing regulation that should never have been applied to Alaska,” adding that it hurts the timber industry but “also affects mining, transportation, energy and more.”She also said that “lifting the roadless rule would not automatically result in the development of more of the forest.” Lifting the rule, she said, would not affect the entire forest but would open about nine million of the forest’s 16 million acres. The rest of the land would remain protected under other state and federal statutes.Environmentalists said the devastation to the forest could still be consequential.“Make no mistake,” said Adam Kolton, executive director of Alaska Wilderness League, an advocacy group. “This is about gutting protections for the largest carbon sink and the most biologically rich national forest in the United States. This is America’s Amazon.”Mr. Kolton noted that the opening of the Tongass to development comes as part of a broader push by Mr. Trump to lift longstanding protections across Alaska’s wilderness. The administration has also opened up the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, and this year proposed to open almost all of the National Petroleum Reserve, far to the west of the refuge, to additional drilling.“They are places that sit at the center of three big crises our country is facing — the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis and racial justice,” said Mr. Kolton, noting that Alaska Native tribes living in those areas have also opposed the developments.The administration had until last month been moving swiftly to grant a permit to Pebble Mine, a vast proposed gold and copper extraction facility, until the president’s son Donald J. Trump Jr. publicly opposed it. Last month the administration imposed new conditions on that project which could delay the permit until after the election.",nytimes,"Trump Administration Releases Plan to Open Tongass Forest to Logging onThe Bureau of Land Management is preparing to open a sacred sanctuary for the so-called sacred savages in the Tongass Forest over the next few years, according to documents posted by the agency's website.""The land has been zoned for a long time for mining, trapping, mining on its own, and there would be logging in a variety of ways,"" a BLM official writes in the early May filing from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality and Performance.

The deal put an end to the ban in 2011, the BLM says, and was approved by Congress.""The intent of the proposed new sanctuary will be to promote Oregon tourism and employment in areas designated for the national forest as well as other national wilderness areas in the Tongass Forest,"" the BLM explains.",GPT-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We’ll Have to Learn to Live With Smoke. Here’s Why.,"PORTLAND, Ore. — For a full week this month, my family did not leave our house here in this famously outdoorsy city. At times, smoke from the state’s huge wildfires made it hard to see to the end of the block. Sometimes, we could barely see across the street.The smoke was extreme, yes. But it was also a glimpse of the future. “We’re not going to get off of this wildfire train anytime soon,” said Jennifer Balch, a fire scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “The big question is, how do we want our smoke?”Once upon a time, smoke was simply part of life in the West. Many ecosystems evolved to tolerate and even depend on fire, which occurred regularly because of lightning, Native American burning practices, and later, settlers. These blazes were often small. In the early 20th century, however, the U.S. government resolved to stamp out wildfires. And for a while, it succeeded, ushering the country through decades of anomalously fire-free, smoke-free summers.Now, that legacy of suppression has created a fire debt that must be paid back — with interest, because of climate change. And that means learning to live with smoke again. “We’re going to have to accept that you are going to have seasonal smoke in the same way that you may have seasonal allergies,” said Stephen Pyne, an environmental historian and emeritus professor at Arizona State University.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyScientists say that warmer, drier conditions will continue to fuel uncontrolled fires like the recent conflagrations that erupted across the West, producing dangerous palls of intense smoke. However, Dr. Balch and others said they hoped these catastrophes would build public support for a different kind of fire: controlled burning that simulates natural processes and reduces the risk of megafires.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.So-called prescribed fires also generate smoke, but at much lower levels and usually in the spring and late fall. Fire managers also try to conduct burns on days when weather conditions limit smoke exposure. The practice is common in the southeastern United States, but, elsewhere, the anti-fire messages of Smokey Bear still prevail, said John Bailey, a fire expert at Oregon State University. “We’ve just been over-indoctrinated,” he said.Any kind of fire carries some risks, and on rare occasions, prescribed burns have gotten out of control. But catching a whiff of smoke shouldn’t inherently inspire fear, Dr. Bailey said. It could also make people feel “relief that we are managing the fuels and managing the risk rather than waiting to be victim.”That mentality already exists among members of the Yurok tribe in California, which has a long tradition of managing the land with fire. When people drive past controlled burns, they honk their horns in appreciation, said Margo Robbins, the executive director of the Cultural Fire Management Council, a nonprofit group. “They stop and tell us how glad that they are that we are doing this.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyClimate Fwd: What on earth is going on? Get the latest news about climate change, plus tips on how you can help.Sign UpStill, wider use of prescribed fire could extend the smoke season in many places, and researchers don’t fully understand how the health impacts of prolonged, low-level exposure compare to those from short, high doses of pollution.Medical experts do know that there is no safe level of smoke, which causes a litany of respiratory, cardiovascular and other health problems. And that means society will have to adapt.For many, life could look a bit like it has in the Pacific Northwest these last few weeks: hunkering inside on the worst days with doors and windows sealed, running air-conditioners and purifiers. When venturing out, masks may become routine, “the same way we wear glasses or hearing aids,” Dr. Pyne said.Dr. Bailey said he suspected that some residents might even undertake seasonal migrations — “smoke birds” instead of “snow birds.”Those strategies may work for people with flexible jobs, well-built houses, and extra income. But “we should be thinking about those who don’t have the means to do that,” said Colleen Reid, a health geographer and environmental epidemiologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder.Fire scientists agree on the need for accurate long-range smoke forecasting and robust warning systems to alert the public to risks. In some places, including in the South, residents already receive advance notice about prescribed fires through social media, list serves, or fliers left on doors, said Jennifer Fawcett, an extension associate at North Carolina State University.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyIn non-pandemic times, clean-air shelters offer relief for people with drafty homes and those with no shelter at all. In the long run, though, buildings and houses should be designed or retrofitted to keep smoke out and filter whatever gets in, Dr. Bailey said.As with Covid, essential workers face the greatest threats from smoke, and many have underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable, Dr. Reid said. To protect them, governments may have to consider steps like prohibiting outdoor work, such as harvesting, on the most dangerous days, she said.Dr. Pyne said that learning to live with smoke called for even more change, like reining in industrial sources of air pollution. “That would create some space for fire and smoke where we want it,” he said.After all, smoke has a place in the West. “It’s not that smoke is intrinsically bad any more than fire is intrinsically bad. It’s how it interacts with how we live,” he said. “And part of that problem is deciding, are we living in a way that makes sense?”",nytimes,"We’ll Have to Learn to Live With Smoke.

A ‘Crossroads’ for Humanity: Earth’s Biodiversity Is Still Collapsing,"The world is failing to address a catastrophic biodiversity collapse that not only threatens to wipe out beloved species and invaluable genetic diversity, but endangers humanity’s food supply, health and security, according to a sweeping United Nations report issued on Tuesday.When governments act to protect and restore nature, the authors found, it works. But despite commitments made 10 years ago, nations have not come close to meeting the scale of the crisis, which continues to worsen because of unsustainable farming, overfishing, burning of fossil fuels and other activities.“Humanity stands at a crossroads,” the report said.It comes as the devastating consequences that can result from an unhealthy relationship with nature are on full display: A pandemic that very likely jumped from bats has upended life worldwide, and wildfires, worsened by climate change and land management policies, are ravaging the American West.“These things are a sign of what is to come,” said David Cooper, an author of the report and the deputy executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, the global treaty underlying the assessment. “These things will only get worse if we don’t change course.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe report looked at a decade of efforts by national governments. In 2010, after painstaking scientific work and arduous negotiation, almost every country in the world signed on to 20 goals under the convention to staunch the biodiversity hemorrhage.At the time, the science was already clear: Human activity was decimating animals and plants across the planet, causing a wave of extinctions and throwing ecosystems so out of balance that the domino effects threatened humans themselves. The agreement, with a deadline of 2020 for the new goals, was a hard-won diplomatic triumph.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.The report, which assesses progress on the 20 goals, has found that the world is doing far too little.“Some progress has been made, but it’s not good enough,” said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the leader of the U.N. convention.ImageA logging operation in Moraes Almeida, a town on the Trans-Amazonian Highway in Pará State, Brazil, last year.Credit...Nelson Almeida/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAs with climate change, scientific alarms on biodiversity loss have gone largely unheeded as the problem intensifies.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyLast year, an exhaustive international report concluded that humans had reshaped the natural world so drastically that one million species of animals and plants were at risk of extinction. This year, the World Economic Forum’s annual global risk report identified biodiversity loss, in addition to climate change, as one of the most urgent threats, saying that “human-driven nature and biodiversity loss is threatening life on our planet.” Last week, a respected index of animal life showed that, on average, the populations of almost 4,400 monitored mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish had declined by 68 percent since 1970.At the global level, only six of the biodiversity convention’s 20 targets were partially achieved and none were fully achieved.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/13:56-0:00transcriptHow to Stop the Next PandemicIt’s not just Covid-19. Pathogens once confined to nature are making their way into humans on a more regular basis. And it’s our fault.This graph can tell you a lot about your future. Each bar shows how many new infectious diseases emerged in a year. In 1944, there was one. In ’48, three. We have no immunity to new pathogens. Each disease on this list posed a new pandemic threat. It was around 1960 when the number began to rise. By the time 1990 rolled around, it wasn’t just two or three new diseases that year — there were 18. Soon after, the trend became so clear, a scientist appeared on TV with a warning. “What worries me the most is that we’re going to miss the next emerging disease, that we’re going to suddenly find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.” That was 17 years ago. And today, stuck at home in a seemingly never-ending pandemic purgatory, it appears that we did not heed his warning. Covid-19 has opened our eyes to the danger. But has it opened them enough to look past this pandemic to what our future holds? We tracked down that same scientist today to ask him: How do you stop the next pandemic? He said the trend isn’t looking good. “We see an increased frequency of emerging pandemics. We also still have the ones that emerged recently. We still have H.I.V. We still have Ebola. We still have H1N1. So we’re adding to the stock of known pandemic pathogens with new ones at an increasing rate. That’s not a good place for us as a species right now.” If you want to know how to stop the next pandemic, you first need to know why they’re happening. “We humans are an ecological anomaly. There have never been 7.7 billion large-body vertebrates of one species on this planet before in the history of earth.” This is David Quammen. He’s a — “— a very unmystical, black-hole Darwinian materialist.” Well, David’s a storyteller. He’s been writing about the origin of infectious diseases for decades. “So we are unprecedented, and we’re causing ecological wreckage that’s unprecedented, and there are consequences of that.” [explosions] “Pandemics emerge due to our ecological footprint. And our ecological footprint is accelerating exponentially.” Remember this guy? That’s Peter Daszak, the scientist who warned us in 2003. He’s sometimes referred to as a virus hunter. He goes out to preemptively find viruses before they find us. “It’s the connection between humans and animals that’s driving this. And that connection happens where people move into a new region through things like road building and deforestation, mining, palm oil production, timber and livestock production. People move into new areas. They come across wildlife that we’ve not really had much contact with. The pathogens spill over into them, and then can spread through that connectivity.” [birds squawking] “We’re encroaching on their habitats. And just many, many more opportunities for spillover events to occur.” Christian Walzer is a global veterinarian and executive director for the Wildlife Conservation Society. “The destruction happening at the edge of forests is one of the areas where we’re very concerned. Changing the trees that bats, for example, would roost on, they may be driven to an edge. They may be driven into an area where there’s more human population. And suddenly, you create a contact area which didn’t exist before.” So what do these new contact areas look like? In this video, we’re going to show you three ways in which our changing relationship with wildlife is increasingly creating dangerous pandemic possibilities. So let’s say you want to sell toothpaste. No, peanut butter. Wait, wait shampoo. Never mind, it doesn’t matter. In all of those cases, you need palm oil. So you burn down a forest in Malaysia to grow palm trees. But that forest was home to some bats. So the bats find a new home, near some fruit trees on a pig farm. But soon, a virus from those bats makes its way into the farmers who own the property. This isn’t science fiction. This is how the Nipah virus came to humans. “Why was it getting from the fruit bats to the people? Because of habitat destruction. Most of the forest in northern Malaysia, where the bats would ordinarily be living wild and feeding on wild fruit, most of that forest had been destroyed. In place of the forest, among other human enterprises, were giant pig farms, piggeries, where thousands of pigs were kept in a single corral, being raised for meat. Some of those corrals were shaded by domestic fruit trees that were planted to grow mangoes or to grow starfruit for another revenue stream for these pig farms. So the bats, having lost their wild habitat, are attracted to the domestic fruit trees. They come in, they eat the mango, they eat the starfruit, they drop the pulp into the pig corrals. And with it, they drop their feces and their urine and their virus. It gets into the pigs, spreads through the pigs, then gets in the pig farmers, pork sellers, and other people.” Land use change is one big reason more infectious diseases are making their way into humans. However, it’s not just animal habitat we need to worry about. Animal diversity can be just as important. “Loss of biodiversity itself has led to emergence of disease. When you lose species, you tend to be left with certain groups. And if they happen to carry viruses, and if they dominate the landscape, you will be exposed to those viruses more than others.” This story doesn’t begin in the jungles of Africa or forests of Southeast Asia. We begin in the American suburbs. “If humans cut down the forest and turn it into a suburb, like those beautiful suburbs we know in semi-rural Connecticut, where there are great big lawns in front of nice houses, and there are hedges, and then there’s somebody else’s house with a great big lawn in front of it, that’s really good habitat for white-footed mice, and also for white-tailed deer. Not so good for larger mammals, like foxes, like weasels, or for birds of prey. So the hawks and the owls tend to disappear, the foxes and the weasels tend to disappear from this environment. What happens then? You get more white-footed mice. You get an abundance of white-footed mice because their predators are not suppressing them.” Having an abundance of white-footed mice wouldn’t be so bad, except they are the natural reservoir host of Lyme disease. This means they harbor the bacteria, but it doesn’t make them sick. So if there was a biological diverse landscape, well, then — “The pathogen is shared amongst the various hosts that are in that landscape. Many of these hosts are incompetent and are unable to actually transmit the disease. And so it becomes a dilution effect.” “The net result of this reduction in biological diversity, changing the landscape, making it more fragmented, less forested, is more ticks infecting more little kids when they go out to roll around in the grass and bust through the hedges. So there is more Lyme disease.” And yet, Covid-19 may not have started this way at all. “In view of the ongoing outbreak, if you create a completely artificial interface where you go and capture animals regionally, globally, and bring them together at one place, like at a wildlife trading market, then you’re obviously creating fantastic opportunities for viruses to spill over.” A pathogen from an animal might not be able to spill over directly into humans, but it could spill over into another animal, evolve or adapt, and then infect humans. With a rotating variety of animals stacked on top of each other, the pandemic possibilities are significant. This is one theory of how the coronavirus may have started in China. The thing is, in the past, a spillover event from this wildlife market may not have affected you. “We also have to take one step back from the sort of very romantic idea that these are isolated communities living in central Africa. You know, I always point out that a rat which you capture somewhere in northern Congo now, within 12 hours, you’re in Brazzaville.” “The Republic of the Congo now has a new modern highway and economic artery thanks to Chinese assistance.” See, just 10 years ago, that would have been impossible. But then, well, China — “The national highway was complete —” China wanted access to minerals to mine. In exchange, they helped with infrastructure. Now, there’s a road. They’ve created accessways, not only for the rare earths which are so important for your mobile phone, but for viruses as well. “If you catch the plane that evening and you take your rat with you because you want to bring it to your family in Paris, it’s less than 24 hours from a very, very remote community all the way to Paris.” But luggage is screened, you say. The rat would get caught. Maybe. But really, the rat isn’t the biggest threat. It’s you. Your bag gets screened. Your blood does not. “We all have a share of the responsibility. It’s not just people in China who want to eat bats or who want to eat pangolins. That may be the immediate cause of this spillover, but in terms of the initiation of these things, generally, there is also enough blame, enough responsibility to go around.” The three ways in which a pandemic could start shown in this video all have one thing in common — us. “Here’s what we did. We changed the planet so significantly and so fundamentally that we dominate every ecosystem on earth, right now. We are the dominant vertebrate species. Our livestock are the dominant biomass on the planet. And that’s the issue. What we’ve done is we’ve created this pathway through our consumption habits by which viruses can get from wildlife into people and then infect us. And our response is we blame one country versus another, we blame people who eat one species over people who don’t eat another and we blame nature. Well, no. We need to point the finger directly at ourselves. This is not a whiny argument that the world’s falling apart and it’s our fault, this is an argument that says we are the reason why this happens. We, therefore, have the power to change it.” So how do you stop the next pandemic? “Well, this is what you do. No. 1, you find out what viruses there are in wildlife. We estimate 1.7 million unknown viruses. Let’s go and discover them. Let’s get the viral sequences. Let’s get them into the hands of vaccine and drug developers, and get them to design vaccines and drugs that are broadly effective — not just against one pathogen, but against a number of pathogens. But No. 2, and critically, we need to work with the communities that are on the front line of this. And that’s a solution that the public are less excited by. It’s old-fashioned. It’s working in foreign countries with different communities that do different things. It’s hard work, and it’s less attractive to the voting public. We’ve got to do all of the above. High-tech, low-tech, but focused on prevention. It’s possible and it’s doable. Let’s get on and do it.” Great. Let’s do it. No more pandemics. There’s just one problem — money. “Please, in the back.” “Thank you, Mr. President. U.S. intelligence is saying this week that the N.I.H., under the Obama administration in 2015, gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?” “We will end that grant very quickly, but —” That’s Donald Trump canceling a grant that was funding research to stop pandemics, including studying coronaviruses in bats. But the grant wasn’t going to China. It was going to — you guessed it — Peter Daszak. That grant started in 2015. “2015? Who was president then, I wonder?” “We have to put in place an infrastructure, not just here at home, but globally that allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly.” This is not a new fight. “But if we wait for a pandemic to appear, it will be too late to prepare.” What is new is our reaction to it. “It’s nobody’s fault — it’s not like — who could have ever predicted anything like this?” “What worries me the most is that we’re going to miss the next emerging disease.” If we don’t want more Covid-19-like events in the future, we need to stop pandemics before they happen. That means depoliticizing pandemics and investing in prevention. “I think we need to wake up. There’s a certain moment right now where the public around the world, because this pandemic has got to every country on the planet, the public now see their own health as intimately connected to why these pandemics emerge through the wildlife trade or deforestation. So we need to really drive that message home that producing a healthier planet will actually save our own lives and improve our own healths.”{""@context"":""http://schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""@id"":""https://www.nytimes.com/video/health/100000007293397/covid-pandemics-causes-documentary.html"",""description"":""It’s not just Covid-19.

Each bar shows how many new infectious diseases emerged in a year. In 1944, there was one. In ’48, three. We have no immunity to new pathogens. Each disease on this list posed a new pandemic threat. It was around 1960 when the number began to rise. By the time 1990 rolled around, it wasn’t just two or three new diseases that year — there were 18. Soon after, the trend became so clear, a scientist appeared on TV with a warning. “What worries me the most is that we’re going to miss the next emerging disease, that we’re going to suddenly find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.” That was 17 years ago. And today, stuck at home in a seemingly never-ending pandemic purgatory, it appears that we did not heed his warning. Covid-19 has opened our eyes to the danger. But has it opened them enough to look past this pandemic to what our future holds? We tracked down that same scientist today to ask him: How do you stop the next pandemic? He said the trend isn’t looking good. “We see an increased frequency of emerging pandemics. We also still have the ones that emerged recently. We still have H.I.V. We still have Ebola. We still have H1N1. So we’re adding to the stock of known pandemic pathogens with new ones at an increasing rate. That’s not a good place for us as a species right now.” If you want to know how to stop the next pandemic, you first need to know why they’re happening. “We humans are an ecological anomaly. There have never been 7.7 billion large-body vertebrates of one species on this planet before in the history of earth.” This is David Quammen. He’s a — “— a very unmystical, black-hole Darwinian materialist.” Well, David’s a storyteller. He’s been writing about the origin of infectious diseases for decades. “So we are unprecedented, and we’re causing ecological wreckage that’s unprecedented, and there are consequences of that.” [explosions] “Pandemics emerge due to our ecological footprint. And our ecological footprint is accelerating exponentially.” Remember this guy? That’s Peter Daszak, the scientist who warned us in 2003. He’s sometimes referred to as a virus hunter. He goes out to preemptively find viruses before they find us. “It’s the connection between humans and animals that’s driving this. And that connection happens where people move into a new region through things like road building and deforestation, mining, palm oil production, timber and livestock production. People move into new areas. They come across wildlife that we’ve not really had much contact with. The pathogens spill over into them, and then can spread through that connectivity.” [birds squawking] “We’re encroaching on their habitats. And just many, many more opportunities for spillover events to occur.” Christian Walzer is a global veterinarian and executive director for the Wildlife Conservation Society. “The destruction happening at the edge of forests is one of the areas where we’re very concerned. Changing the trees that bats, for example, would roost on, they may be driven to an edge. They may be driven into an area where there’s more human population. And suddenly, you create a contact area which didn’t exist before.” So what do these new contact areas look like? In this video, we’re going to show you three ways in which our changing relationship with wildlife is increasingly creating dangerous pandemic possibilities. So let’s say you want to sell toothpaste. No, peanut butter. Wait, wait shampoo. Never mind, it doesn’t matter. In all of those cases, you need palm oil. So you burn down a forest in Malaysia to grow palm trees. But that forest was home to some bats. So the bats find a new home, near some fruit trees on a pig farm. But soon, a virus from those bats makes its way into the farmers who own the property. This isn’t science fiction. This is how the Nipah virus came to humans. “Why was it getting from the fruit bats to the people? Because of habitat destruction. Most of the forest in northern Malaysia, where the bats would ordinarily be living wild and feeding on wild fruit, most of that forest had been destroyed. In place of the forest, among other human enterprises, were giant pig farms, piggeries, where thousands of pigs were kept in a single corral, being raised for meat. Some of those corrals were shaded by domestic fruit trees that were planted to grow mangoes or to grow starfruit for another revenue stream for these pig farms. So the bats, having lost their wild habitat, are attracted to the domestic fruit trees. They come in, they eat the mango, they eat the starfruit, they drop the pulp into the pig corrals. And with it, they drop their feces and their urine and their virus. It gets into the pigs, spreads through the pigs, then gets in the pig farmers, pork sellers, and other people.” Land use change is one big reason more infectious diseases are making their way into humans. However, it’s not just animal habitat we need to worry about. Animal diversity can be just as important. “Loss of biodiversity itself has led to emergence of disease. When you lose species, you tend to be left with certain groups. And if they happen to carry viruses, and if they dominate the landscape, you will be exposed to those viruses more than others.” This story doesn’t begin in the jungles of Africa or forests of Southeast Asia. We begin in the American suburbs. “If humans cut down the forest and turn it into a suburb, like those beautiful suburbs we know in semi-rural Connecticut, where there are great big lawns in front of nice houses, and there are hedges, and then there’s somebody else’s house with a great big lawn in front of it, that’s really good habitat for white-footed mice, and also for white-tailed deer. Not so good for larger mammals, like foxes, like weasels, or for birds of prey. So the hawks and the owls tend to disappear, the foxes and the weasels tend to disappear from this environment. What happens then? You get more white-footed mice. You get an abundance of white-footed mice because their predators are not suppressing them.” Having an abundance of white-footed mice wouldn’t be so bad, except they are the natural reservoir host of Lyme disease. This means they harbor the bacteria, but it doesn’t make them sick. So if there was a biological diverse landscape, well, then — “The pathogen is shared amongst the various hosts that are in that landscape. Many of these hosts are incompetent and are unable to actually transmit the disease. And so it becomes a dilution effect.” “The net result of this reduction in biological diversity, changing the landscape, making it more fragmented, less forested, is more ticks infecting more little kids when they go out to roll around in the grass and bust through the hedges. So there is more Lyme disease.” And yet, Covid-19 may not have started this way at all. “In view of the ongoing outbreak, if you create a completely artificial interface where you go and capture animals regionally, globally, and bring them together at one place, like at a wildlife trading market, then you’re obviously creating fantastic opportunities for viruses to spill over.” A pathogen from an animal might not be able to spill over directly into humans, but it could spill over into another animal, evolve or adapt, and then infect humans. With a rotating variety of animals stacked on top of each other, the pandemic possibilities are significant. This is one theory of how the coronavirus may have started in China. The thing is, in the past, a spillover event from this wildlife market may not have affected you. “We also have to take one step back from the sort of very romantic idea that these are isolated communities living in central Africa. You know, I always point out that a rat which you capture somewhere in northern Congo now, within 12 hours, you’re in Brazzaville.” “The Republic of the Congo now has a new modern highway and economic artery thanks to Chinese assistance.” See, just 10 years ago, that would have been impossible. But then, well, China — “The national highway was complete —” China wanted access to minerals to mine. In exchange, they helped with infrastructure. Now, there’s a road. They’ve created accessways, not only for the rare earths which are so important for your mobile phone, but for viruses as well. “If you catch the plane that evening and you take your rat with you because you want to bring it to your family in Paris, it’s less than 24 hours from a very, very remote community all the way to Paris.” But luggage is screened, you say. The rat would get caught. Maybe. But really, the rat isn’t the biggest threat. It’s you. Your bag gets screened. Your blood does not. “We all have a share of the responsibility. It’s not just people in China who want to eat bats or who want to eat pangolins. That may be the immediate cause of this spillover, but in terms of the initiation of these things, generally, there is also enough blame, enough responsibility to go around.” The three ways in which a pandemic could start shown in this video all have one thing in common — us. “Here’s what we did. We changed the planet so significantly and so fundamentally that we dominate every ecosystem on earth, right now. We are the dominant vertebrate species. Our livestock are the dominant biomass on the planet. And that’s the issue. What we’ve done is we’ve created this pathway through our consumption habits by which viruses can get from wildlife into people and then infect us. And our response is we blame one country versus another, we blame people who eat one species over people who don't eat another and we blame nature. Well, no. We need to point the finger directly at ourselves. This is not a whiny argument that the world’s falling apart and it’s our fault, this is an argument that says we are the reason why this happens. We, therefore, have the power to change it.” So how do you stop the next pandemic? “Well, this is what you do. No. 1, you find out what viruses there are in wildlife. We estimate 1.7 million unknown viruses. Let’s go and discover them. Let’s get the viral sequences. Let’s get them into the hands of vaccine and drug developers, and get them to design vaccines and drugs that are broadly effective — not just against one pathogen, but against a number of pathogens. But No. 2, and critically, we need to work with the communities that are on the front line of this. And that’s a solution that the public are less excited by. It’s old-fashioned. It’s working in foreign countries with different communities that do different things. It’s hard work, and it’s less attractive to the voting public. We’ve got to do all of the above. High-tech, low-tech, but focused on prevention. It’s possible and it’s doable. Let’s get on and do it.” Great. Let’s do it. No more pandemics. There’s just one problem — money. “Please, in the back.\"" “Thank you, Mr. President.

Pathogens once confined to nature are making their way into humans on a more regular basis. And it’s our fault.The destruction of habitats such as forests, mangroves and grasslands was not cut in half. Overfishing did not decrease. Governments did not stop subsidizing fossil fuels, fertilizers and pesticides that are contributing to the biodiversity crisis.Indeed, the report estimates that governments around the world spend $500 billion per year on environmentally harmful initiatives, while total public and private financing for biodiversity came to a fraction of that: $80 billion to $90 billion.“Many governments, within their ministry of environment, have a lot of ambition for biodiversity,” said Anne Larigauderie, an ecologist who attended the conference in 2010 that adopted the 20 targets. “But they don’t have enough power compared to the other ministries: agriculture, transportation, energy.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDr. Larigauderie manages the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, an independent intergovernmental organization that provides science on biodiversity loss. Even national leaders who say they understand the crisis, she said, find it difficult to resist lobbies, short-term interests and their desire for re-election.Of 196 countries, 167 submitted national reports on their efforts. The United States did not, because it was not a party to the treaty.The biggest driver of biodiversity loss on land is habitat destruction and degradation, mainly because of farming. At sea, the biggest problem is overfishing. Climate change will play an increasing role as its effects intensify over the coming years. And the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are inextricably linked. For example, since trees soak up and help store carbon, clearing forests intensifies climate change, while restoring them helps mitigate it.“By investing in nature, not only can we reduce extinctions, we can help address the climate issue,” Mr. Cooper said. “We can also have healthier landscapes and healthier people.”ImageNajin, one of two northern white rhinos at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, in August before a procedure to harvest her eggs.Credit...Ol Pajeta Conservancy, via ReutersDespite the overall failure, the report highlights areas of progress around the world, bright spots showing that people have the power to protect and restore nature, not just destroy it. Conservation efforts have prevented an estimated 11 to 25 bird and mammal extinctions over the last decade; without these actions, researchers calculated, the number most likely would have been two to four times as high.“If you put in place the policies, they do work,” Mr. Cooper said.To praise and inspire, the report is peppered with success stories big and small.

Guatemala rewarded landowners who restored forests with native species.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut such actions must be scaled up significantly. The scale of the crisis and the sheer number of humans living on the planet mean that conservation alone will not be enough. Instead, the report said, societies will have to transform how they produce and consume food and other goods. One of the targets addressed this directly: Governments, businesses and stakeholders at all levels were to take steps, at least, to achieve plans for sustainable production and consumption. Three-quarters of the countries reported back on their progress; of those, only one-tenth are on track, the report found.“Our economic and financing systems are all screwed up,” said Robert Watson, a former chairman of two high-profile panels, one on climate change at the United Nations and the other on biodiversity. “We use gross domestic product as a measure of economic growth. It completely ignores nature. It completely ignores human well being. And so it’s a very limited concept.”Without transformational change, the report said, all humanity will be affected, with Indigenous people and the poor bearing the worst effects.Scientists say food supplies are threatened by ecosystem collapse, climate change, the decline in pollinators and soil degradation from unsustainable farming. Conflict follows food and water scarcity.The report calls for eight urgent transitions in the way we use lands and oceans, grow our food, eat, build our cities, manage our fresh water and more. For example, we must eat less meat and fish, bring nature into cities and quickly stop burning fossil fuels.With these bold changes, it is not too late to slow and ultimately reverse this crisis, the report found.“We still need this planet to live on,"” Ms. Mrema said. “And we still need this planet for our children.”""",nytimes,"A ‘Crossroads’ for Humanity: Earth’s Biodiversity Is Still Collapsing at the FieldFDA has been at work since before the World Trade Center went down (now retired, sadly).

Human Weakness Is Responsible for This Poisonous Air,"Among the few remaining advantages that Americans can claim over other countries is the relative cleanliness of our air. Air pollution is a leading risk factor for early death; it is linked to an estimated four million premature fatalities around the world annually. But over the last 50 years, since Congress passed environmental legislation in 1970, air quality in the United States has steadily improved. Today, America’s air is significantly cleaner than in much of the rest of the world, including in many of our wealthy, industrialized peers.Well, not literally today, considering I needed an N95 mask to walk to the mailbox this morning. Over the last few years, for weeks and sometimes months in late summer and fall, my home state, California, and other parts of the American West erupt in hellish blaze, and plumes of smoke turn the heavens visibly toxic.In some of the country’s most populous cities in the last few weeks, the concentration of dangerous particulates in the air shot up to levels worse than the averages in the most polluted cities in China, India and Pakistan. Ash generated by some of the largest wildfires in California’s and Oregon’s history fell across the region like snow. The sky burned Martian orange — a hue so alien that smartphones struggled to faithfully photograph it.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyI have been searching for some glint of optimism during an otherwise bleak time. While choking through a walk this past weekend (I had to leave the house), I came up with this: Maybe such disasters will finally force us to recognize the steep costs of incompetent, neglectful, uncaring government.Like America’s failed response to the coronavirus, the wildfires and poisonous air are best seen as a product of negligence at all levels of society, from individuals to cities and states to a federal government that, in recent decades, exited the business of getting anything done. These were natural disasters exacerbated by human weaknesses: a reluctance to plan, a preference for denial over prevention, for consumption and convenience over caution, and for quick fixes over lasting change.Journalism for every part of life.Subscribe for $1 a week.Now, the singed chickens are coming home to roost. Militarily and economically, the United States remains an indomitable superpower. But in just about every other way, we have been exposed as a fragile nation, whose overlapping vulnerabilities can be attributed to a political system that has ceased caring about the most basic of citizens’ needs — even that of fresh air.Donald Trump did not cause these fires; no lawmaker did. But as I watched the president’s brief photo op this week — he popped into town near Sacramento on Monday for about two hours, a layover between campaign events in Nevada and Arizona — it struck me that he is the embodiment of a political and cultural rot that will remain long after he’s left the scene.In Sacramento, all of Trump’s familiar tics were on display. There was magical thinking: “It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch,” he told a state official who implored him to recognize that climate change is contributing to worsening wildfire seasons. There was the absence of empathy, with just a perfunctory mention of the people who’ve lost homes and businesses. And there was ego-driven denial. When the official pointed out that scientific consensus disagreed with Trump, the president all but pouted and stuck his fingers in his ears. “I don’t think science knows, actually,” he said.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyScience does know, actually. Trump has argued that California’s fires could be addressed by better forest management. “You gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests,” he said last month. He’s not totally wrong. Experts do say that improved management would mitigate fires (though they prescribe managed burns rather than whatever “cleaning floors” might mean).But that is far from the whole story. A barrage of scientific evidence shows that climate change has intensified droughts and hotter, drier weather across the Western United States, which has made brush, trees and other organic matter more combustible. According to one study, between 1984 and 2015, climate change contributed to the near-doubling of the geographical area vulnerable to wildfires in the West. To put it in a way that might register with the president: We now have twice as much floor to clean.If you live in the West, the connection between climate change and fire is unavoidable. A month ago, we suffered a record-breaking heat wave that baked the earth into kindling. Then the match was struck. The Bay Area woke up to a sky flashing blue with dry lightning — lightning unaccompanied by rain. Nearly 9,000 strikes hit the ground, sparking fires across the region.Can the climate-denying right really continue to ignore this basic cause-and-effect? Trump’s brand of denial is hardly unique. In some ways, it is embedded in our political system. Trump has ignored climate change because it’s been politically easy to do so. The effects of climate change are imprecise, and in the case of the wildfires, they’re almost not his problem, as the Electoral College allows him to write off the West Coast entirely. (Trump often tweets as if “blue states” are not even part of the country.)The political challenges will remain even if Joe Biden wins the White House and Democrats gain control of Congress. Environmental legislation is difficult: It imposes identifiable short-term costs and inconveniences on people and businesses in return for long-term benefits for society as a whole.It may seem that passing rules to protect the earth would require unusual political courage. But we have tackled these problems before. The late 1960s and early 1970s were no model of political comity in the United States; that era, like ours, was a time of intense polarization, with a citizenry restive for change.But according to a fascinating history of the Clean Air Act by Brigham Daniels, Andrew P. Follett and Joshua Davis that was published recently in the Hastings Law Journal, Richard Nixon and Democrats in Congress passed the law precisely because Americans had become so cynical about their government. Lawmakers saw fixing the environment as a difficult goal they could nevertheless achieve: “Vietnam, civil rights, and Soviet tension may all have been out of reach, but cleaning the air seemed to be attainable, and gains could be measured and seen,” the authors write.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe same logic holds today. Dirty air and fire surround us, but we still have the collective capacity to mitigate them. Breathing is important.

Chris Wallace's framing on 'race and violence' debate topic is wrong on so many levels,"Chris Wallace has the well-deserved reputation of a hard-hitting and fair journalist. He is one of the few at Fox News willing to bring as much heat to President Donald Trump as he is to any Democrat or progressive activist. That doesn't mean Wallace is immune to tone-deafness -- especially when it comes to matters involving Black people. This week Wallace, who will moderate the highly anticipated first presidential debate, announced the general subject areas for the encounter between Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. The topics included: ""The Trump and Biden Records,"" ""The Supreme Court,"" ""Covid-19,"" ""The Economy,"" ""The Integrity of the Election."" Then, there is this one: ""Race and Violence in Our Cities.""   Say what? Wallace's framing of the topic of protests over police killing of Black people has drawn criticism -- much of it partisan -- that it is more akin to a Fox News chyron than a politically-neutral approach. Bend the Arc, a liberal Jewish organization, termed it ""barely-coded language that reinforces anti-Black fear mongering.""  Let me add my voice to this condemnation because Wallace's framing is so wrong on so many levels. Wallace has the power to set public expectations on how the subjects will be debated by the way he tees them up. And, with regard to the issue of police brutality and public reaction to it, he has done so in a one-sided, intellectually lazy and racist manner. For starters, his approach is nakedly partisan and blatantly favorable to Trump. In the months since George Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police, the President has fought to keep the focus on the violence that has marred some of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations against police brutality, rather than talking about the police misconduct that prompted the protests in the first place. Wallace's framing follows in lockstep with Trump's rhetoric, and it has the potential of forcing the discussion onto the President's turf. It is equivalent to Wallace coming up with a subject called, say, ""Presidential Character and Trump's Lying."" Wallace's approach also ties Black people to violence. It is telling that the only subject where Wallace mentions race involves violence perpetrated by or in the name of Black people, a framing made clear by including the phrase, ""in our cities."" If Wallace wanted to bring forward the issue of politically inspired unrest, he could have framed it as ""Violent Protests and Domestic Terrorism."" That way he could have invited participants to engage on both the torching of sections of Portland as well as white extremists marching in Charlottesville, or driving vehicles into crowds of peaceful demonstrators.  But no, if it's violence, it's got to be Black people. And aren't there a host of other ways to bring the issue of ""race"" into a presidential debate? How about ""Blacks and Browns and the Economy?"" Or maybe, ""Racial Disparities in Health?""  Are racial inequities in wealth and disparities in health outcomes -- and the solutions to each -- not worthy subjects of debate? Or is it just violence? And while we're at it, can we stop with euphemisms? When Wallace use the term ""race"" he has, in this instance, fallen to the all-too-common habit of using the word to be talking about just Black people. Seldom is the term associated with the actions of White people; giving the strong impression that White people, unlike Blacks, Hispanics and Asians, have no race. Think about it. When someone puts up a headline or a chyron that says, ""Race and Covid-19,"" you can be sure the story or the discussion will be about the disproportionate number of Black and Brown people dying from coronavirus infection. It will not be about the mask-less White bikers rallying in Sturgis, South Dakota, or parties at White fraternity houses, or crowded pool bars during holidays at Lake of the Ozarks. Images of overwhelmingly White crowds flouting guidelines meant to stem the spread of Covid-19 have been blasted out on TV and on social media in recent months. But, somehow, the race of those engaging in these kinds of irresponsible behavior is not noted.  Wallace, however, puts the race of those perpetrating violence stemming from BLM protests front and center, even if couched in euphemisms. Coming up with and framing topics for a presidential debate is tough work. One most come up with framing that is as fair, accurate and sensitive as possible. Hard choices, both in subject matter and language need to be made. Critical subjects are sometimes left on the cutting room floor, as climate change was for this one. And considering that this first encounter between Trump and Biden will probably be the most watched ever, the pressure on Wallace and his other panelists is and will be intense.

Federal judge removes acting Bureau of Land Management director after finding he has served unlawfully for 424 days,"A federal judge on Friday ordered acting Bureau of Land Management Director William Perry Pendley to step aside, blocking him from exercising any more authority after finding that he has served unlawfully for more than 400 days. Chief District Judge Brian Morris of the US District Court of Montana ruled that Pendley has served unlawfully for 424 days, in response to a lawsuit brought by Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. Morris additionally ruled Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt cannot pick another person to run the Bureau of Land Management as its acting head because that person must be appointed by the President and Senate-confirmed. The judge gave both sides of the case 10 days to file briefs about which of Pendley's orders must be vacated. ""Pendley has served and continues to serve unlawfully as the Acting BLM Director,"" Morris wrote in his opinion. ""His ascent to Acting BLM Director did not follow any of the permissible paths set forth by the U.S. Constitution or the (Federal Vacancies Reform Act). Pendley has not been nominated by the President and has not been confirmed by the Senate to serve as BLM Director."" He added, ""Secretary Bernhardt lacked the authority to appoint Pendley as an Acting BLM Director under the FVRA. Pendley unlawfully took the temporary position beyond the 210-day maximum allowed by the FVRA. Pendley unlawfully served as Acting BLM Director after the President submitted his permanent appointment to the Senate for confirmation -- another violation of the FVRA. And Pendley unlawfully serves as Acting BLM Director today, under color of the Succession Memo."" Pendley was nominated to be the permanent director of the agency in July but the Trump administration withdrew his nomination in September after a series of controversial statements -- including saying that climate change is not real and falsely saying that there was no credible evidence of a hole in the ozone layer -- were made public by CNN's KFile. The BLM manages 244 million acres of federal lands in the United States -- one out of every 10 acres of land in the country -- along with 30% of the nation's minerals. As acting director of the BLM, Pendley wielded significant authority over the leasing and use of land for mining, recreation, and oil and gas exploration and development along with maintaining environmental protections for federal lands. The agency is currently taking steps to move its headquarters and employees out west. Last year, Pendley became the fifth person to lead the bureau on a temporary basis after the departure of Director Neil Kornze less than a year into the Trump administration. Bullock filed suit in July challenging Pendley's authority.  Pendley, a conservative activist, commentator and lawyer, was appointed by Bernhardt as acting director in July 2019. Morris wrote that, by law, the position of Bureau of Land Management director is required to be confirmed by the Senate. The Trump administration argued that Pendley did not officially have the title of acting director, so the requirement does not apply.  ""Such arguments prove evasive and undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances,"" Morris wrote, adding that the administration referred to Pendley publicly as the agency's director. Interior Department spokesman Conner Swanson told CNN in an email the administration will appeal ""immediately.""  ""This is an outrageous decision that is well outside the bounds of the law,"" Swanson said. Bullock, who is challenging GOP Sen. Steve Daines in a competitive Senate race, tweeted, ""Today's ruling is a win for the Constitution, the rule of law, and our public lands.""",cnn,"Federal judge removes acting Bureau of Land Management director after finding he has served unlawfully for 424 days on bribery caseFDA has fined Federal marshals involved in illegal arrest, detention, and deportation of a convicted felon for bringing the felons to federal prison for 426 daysWendell Wilbur Jr. was arrested in May 2006 after being charged with racketeeringA former senior Pentagon official was found guilty last month of racketeering in one case in connection with the Obama administration's botched reclamation project on the property in McAllenGarrett Breen, who oversees land management for the federal government, resigned after he pleaded guilty on January 4 to serving on his third day of incarceration for involvement in the scheme, and his fourth day of confinement during a hearing of the United States Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in Dallas, Texas, on February 7.",GPT-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opinion: Trump's 2020 campaign strategy is psychological warfare,"During the third presidential debate in 2016, candidate Donald Trump made headlines for refusing to answer Fox News journalist Chris Wallace, who was moderating, on whether he would accept the result of the upcoming election. ""I will look at it at the time. I will keep you in suspense,"" he said, claiming the race was already fixed against him. ""That's not how democracy works,"" replied his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who went on to win the popular vote but lose the election.    Four years later, here we are again. President Trump, once more, baselessly claims the entire electoral system is ""rigged"" to favor his adversary, now Joe Biden, and won't commit to abiding by the outcome. It's still not how democracy works. But now we know better. Trump has little interest in or respect for the democratic process.    Since he appeared on the political scene, Trump has been open about his disdain for democracy. His 2017 characterization of the Constitutional checks and balances on executive power as ""archaic...really a bad thing for the country,"" was a clue that came early in his presidency.  His role models appear to be authoritarian leaders he has praised like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who claim that they maintain open societies but in fact use democratic institutions like elections to maintain themselves in power.  The manipulation of information has always been key to the success of authoritarians. Such leaders don't merely disseminate propaganda at a dizzying rate, but expertly withhold information that counters their principal aim: to maintain themselves in power. The more than 20,000 lies and misleading claims, as counted by the Washington Post, spewed by Trump since he took office get plenty of attention, but what he has refused to disclose is also notable.    From the eternal mystery of his tax returns (which we still don't have) to records of which businesses are receiving pandemic stimulus loans (which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called ""proprietary information"" before the Small Business Administration released the data in July), to what Trump says when he meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin, his administration stands out for all that it tries to avoid telling the public. The results of the 2020 election may fall into this category.   Trump's disregard for transparency and accountability, both bedrock principles of democracy, accounts in part for this situation. Like all authoritarians, the President does not believe he serves the people; rather, the people serve him, stroking his ego  and allegedly enriching his private businesses.  The Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog group, has accused the Trump campaign of breaking campaign finance laws by ""laundering"" tens of millions of dollars in donations through several companies. (A spokesman for the Trump campaign says it complies with all campaign finance laws and FEC regulations.) Trump only cares about serving those Americans who support him, although even his most devoted followers must be kept as dependent as possible on him and distrustful of everyone and everything else. To that end, peddling confusion and signal-boosting conspiracy theories, as he routinely does, is useful. Having supporters risk their lives for him by attending his rallies, unmasked, during a pandemic is a boost.   The unprecedented barrage of misinformation about the American election system he's unleashed as President has its place here. He, without proof, tars mail-in voting -- newly popular due to the pandemic -- as susceptible to fraud and tampering. It's just one talking point of a broader psychological warfare campaign designed to reduce confidence in all institutions that support inquiry, fact-based argumentation and hard data.     The press, members of intelligence and national security agencies and scientists studying climate change and Covid-19 all have been subjected to smear campaigns and accusations of bias or fraud. Now this line of attack  appears to be focused on electoral outcomes, surely leaving many American voters unsure if their votes will even be counted.    This is because some of the scenarios that election experts hypothesize involve Trump ""running down the clock,"" or exploiting the extra time needed to count mail-in ballots. Together with slowdowns or confiscations due to charges of fraud and misconduct, this could delay any firm outcome before the deadline of December 14, which corresponds to the end of the 41-day window mandated by the Electoral Count Act.     States could then appoint electors -- in the current GOP, Republican-led states would likely appoint Trump loyalists -- whose votes would replace those cast at ballot boxes.    That presumably would be just fine with the President, who recently floated his own authoritarian solution to the upcoming election: ""get rid of ballots and you'll have a very...there won't be a transfer [of power to Biden], frankly. There'll be a continuation."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany responded to Trump's refusal to say if he would accept the election outcomes by both assuring the public that there would be a peaceful transfer of power.   But Trump has shown himself to be anything but peaceful. Strongmen succeed when they are able to convince people that the truth is unknowable -- especially election results that might force them out of office -- and that governance is best left in the hands of those who speak and act for them. We can't let that happen in America.",cnn,"Opinion: Trump's 2020 campaign strategy is psychological warfare on the core voters; those core voters, at any rate, are at odds with Donald Trump (and his base).

A British teenager staged a sit-in on an Arctic ice floe to protest climate change,"A British teenager has staged a protest against climate change inside the Arctic Circle.  In the world's most northerly climate strike, Mya-Rose Craig, a passionate ornithologist and nature, climate and equal rights campaigner, was photographed protesting on an ice floe at the Arctic ice edge, north of Svalbard, at 82.2° North earlier this week.   The 18-year-old, who lives near the southwestern English city of Bristol, held up a placard saying ""Youth Strike for Climate."" She spent five hours on the ice, a spokesperson for environmental organization Greenpeace told CNN. Craig, who says on her Twitter page that she is the youngest person to have seen half the world's birds, arrived in the Arctic on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise as part of an expedition documenting the impact of the climate crisis and investigating marine life in the region. The journey, which started from Norway in early September, was timed to coincide with next week's United Nations Summit on Biodiversity, where ""marine protection should be front and center to any discussions about protecting biodiversity,"" Greenpeace said in a statement.  September 25 has been declared a global climate action day by Fridays for Future, a global strike movement that started in August 2018, when Greta Thunberg, then aged 15, launched her climate protest. In a statement issued by Greenpeace, Craig said: ""I'm here because I want to see for myself what's at stake as this crucial protector of the planet, the Arctic Ocean, melts away at a terrifying rate. Today, myself and Fridays For Future activists from all over the world are standing up to call for urgent action against climate breakdown.  ""I'm here to demand that our leaders come together and create ocean sanctuaries to protect this essential but fragile place and at least 30 per cent of our oceans. There is still time to turn things around towards more sustainable energies and lifestyles, and that moment must be now."" Craig told CNN that the trip had been a ""once in a lifetime experience,"" in more ways than one.  ""It feels like a once in a lifetime experience, not only because it has been an amazing trip, but also because I am hyper-aware that the Arctic is disappearing.  ""I have been a climate activist for years but now it has really sunk in just how urgent this issue is.  ""Looking out from the ship it was so easy to picture it all slowly melting and disappearing in the coming two decades."" Earlier this week, scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder said the Arctic sea ice, or the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, had reached its minimum extent for the year, shrinking to the second lowest extent since record-keeping began in 1978. Craig, who has just finished high school, is taking a year out before studying politics and international relations at university next year.  According to Greenpeace, she is one of millions of youth activists and climate strikers demanding action and accountability from global leaders in ""tackling the commodification of nature for profit.""  Earlier this year she shared a platform with Thunberg, addressing 40,000 people in Bristol.  On why young people like herself and Thunberg are demonstrating, she told CNN: ""I really wanted to convey how, as a young person, I feel incredibly desperate about this issue and I feel it's extremely urgent.  ""It makes me really angry when politicians and world leaders don't take action on climate change -- it isn't their future that's melting down the drain.  ""This movement of young people has been so exciting to me. It has the potential to be revolutionary because protests and strikes like this are finally giving young people a voice. People are finally sitting down and listening to us about how we feel about our future."" Posting on Facebook earlier Friday, Craig wrote: ""It has taken me weeks to travel by road and boat to the Arctic edge to bear witness to the Sea Ice Minimum, the lowest level of the ice at the end of each summer. Today, I took part in the most northerly Youth Strike ever, to bear witness to the low ice level and ask you to amplify my voice and those of other young people around the world and demand that our leaders take action now when they meet at the UN General Assembly soon.""",cnn,"A British teenager staged a sit-in on an Arctic ice floe to protest climate change on Tuesday, setting off an angry protest in the high seas.The activist activists, who are from a local branch of Greenpeace, gathered outside their local council for a sit-in.After getting the thumbs up, three Greenpeace members got in the air and started clapping their hands.They were interrupted by a man who raised his hand as a sign of protest, before taking an open and questioning approach and releasing a message.""What is your response to the situation in the Pacific?"" he asked.""What have you done to prevent this happening in the future?

McDonald's exec: The food industry needs to act now to cut greenhouse gas emissions,"As UN Secretary General António Guterres recently declared, the actions we take and the solutions we identify to combat climate change over the next decade will be critical. Yet, no organization can drive change alone. To secure a thriving food system for future generations, the food industry has a significant opportunity -- and responsibility -- to collectively help mitigate the impact of climate change and find more sustainable ways to feed people.   It's no surprise that growing, processing, packaging and distributing enough food to feed billions of people takes considerable energy and resources. According to scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, nearly 24% of greenhouse gases produced by humans annually can be tied back to our global food system and deforestation.  Reducing emissions at scale has to be the food industry's number one priority. But it's only part of the solution. Our approaches to agriculture, forestry and land use hold the potential for some of the most important solutions to climate change. Given that emissions can be pulled out of the atmosphere by soils, forests and oceans, it's critical that we protect these natural ecosystems and invest in food production and agricultural practices that can help restore nature by increasing biodiversity to actively capture carbon through soils and vegetation.  These actions matter because the health and prosperity of people around the world is negatively impacted by climate change -- directly through extreme weather events, like the wildfires currently ravaging the western United States, or indirectly through changes in water and air quality, access to food or lifespans.  As a business leader with a responsibility for driving long-term sustainability and resiliency, I believe the most effective solutions will be those that are pragmatic and inclusive.  Advances in science, research, technology and industry collaboration have already started to uncover many diverse solutions that could propel change forward at scale. For example, farmer and rancher-led programs have shown that regenerative agriculture methods can have the potential to significantly mitigate climate change by capturing carbon in the soil, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing biodiversity of plants and wildlife.  According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), practices like regenerative cattle grazing can be an important tool in preserving grassland ecosystems. The idea is that grasslands must be grazed in order to remain healthy, and while species such as bison have historically played this role across the Northern Great Plains, today well-managed cattle could have the same impact.  WWF has launched a Ranch Systems and Viability Planning network, which McDonald's is backing along with Cargill and the Walmart Foundation, to help conserve the Northern Great Plains, one of the last remaining temperate grasslands in the world. The partnership will build local networks for ranchers across more than one million acres of Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota, helping to leverage existing rich local knowledge and supplement it with additional tools, training and technical assistance to scale-up regenerative practices. One of the most promising findings is that regenerative practices don't just benefit the environment, they can also benefit communities, including farmers and producers. Innovative approaches to land-use and soil health, such as cover cropping, reduced tillage and diversified crop rotations, can improve farm efficiency, production, profits and long-term resilience.  In Nebraska, a five-year, $8.5 million project is being spearheaded to work with farmers to advance proven soil health practices across 100,000 acres of land. This work is key as Nebraska is one of the top states for US beef production and among the top three states for corn production, a key ingredient for cattle feed. What's exciting is a project like this has the potential to sequester 150,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over the course of the project -- equivalent to removing over 32,000 cars from the road in one year.  The biggest challenge is scaling all of this. Because supply chains are so vast -- and the challenge of climate change is so immense -- multi-stakeholder platforms and industry-wide collaborations become much more important. Establishing partnerships and initiatives can be transformational in terms of global reach and scale -- far outweighing what one corporation can achieve alone. It's also vital we listen to and learn from the experts -- in this case, our producers around the world who are already making a positive environmental impact. Of course, the only way to truly implement widespread sustainable change is to drive positive social, economic and environmental benefits for everyone. This is even more urgent because producers and communities in general have been facing significant pressure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We need to take shared responsibility -- from corporations to governments -- for empowering, incentivizing and supporting meaningful action.  The year of 2020 has been an incredibly difficult one, but it has also heightened the importance of pressing forward with climate action across our industry. There is no single roadmap for success, but one thing is certain: Together we must take bold action in order to truly scale solutions across the industry to make the innovative practices of today commonplace tomorrow. Only then can we ensure the long-term resilience of our food system and our planet.",cnn,"McDonald's exec: The food industry needs to act now to cut greenhouse gas emissions at the same rate that we are reducing our electricity costs, before further cuts are inevitable,"" said Brad Parscale, president of the American Association of Forest Service (AAFS) and editor of the American Journal of Forest Nutrition.Parscale said the industry needs to bring its action to ALEC.

South Africa has the world's worst youth unemployment. This job-matching site wants to change that,"""I really count myself blessed to have a job right now,"" says Akhona Zondani. After months of being ignored by recruiters in her home country of South Africa, the economics graduate began using a recruitment website called Giraffe. Compared to the experience of being ""ghosted"" by other recruiters, Zondani says getting guidance every step of the way was like ""a breath of fresh air,"" and she eventually landed a job with an insurance company. Zondani knows she is one of the lucky ones in the current economic climate. South Africa was already in recession and struggling with record-high unemployment before the pandemic. In 2019, it had the world's highest youth unemployment rate, at 56%, and Covid-19 has led to even more job losses. But Giraffe believes it can help those hit the hardest: unskilled and less educated workers. Founded in 2015 by Anish Shivdasani and Shafin Anwarsha, Giraffe has automated the recruitment process, from sourcing candidates to screening them.  Where jobseekers would usually apply for positions on paper or in person, they can now upload their résumé to the online platform, and an algorithm will match them with relevant jobs.   Giraffe was built for mobile devices, which is how most South Africans primarily access the internet, explains Shivdasani. Smartphone penetration in the country has doubled from 2016 to 91% in 2019. Of those with internet access, around 60% use a mobile device. While other job portals and recruitment agencies often target high-skilled jobseekers, Shivdasani says Giraffe's focus is primarily on entry to mid-level jobs. ""We really target the mass segment of the market,"" Shivdasani tells CNN Business. ""We define it as salaries between 3,000 and 25,000 rand ($177 to $1,470) a month."" This income range represents about two-thirds of the total South African workforce, he adds. Shivdasani and Anwarsha met while working as strategy consultants in the telecoms industry. Shivdasani says he had always dreamed of building a platform to solve social problems in South Africa. In brainstorming where to start, he realized that unemployment was at the core of many of them. ""We felt that unemployment is probably the biggest problem in South Africa,"" he says. Giraffe is completely free for jobseekers, explains Shivdasani, and instead charges businesses to post jobs on its platform. It has worked with about 3,000 businesses and currently has one million jobseekers registered on its platform. Shivdasani estimates Giraffe reaches approximately 10 million jobseekers through partnerships with Facebook and Google. Giraffe has even developed a voice note function that lets companies listen to applicants answering questions before inviting them to interview. ""It's a combination of matching, screening and voice clips, which sets us apart from other platforms,"" Shivdasani says.  This year the company received a grant from UNICEF, which it will use to build a content portal to arm jobseekers with career advice. Giraffe declined to disclose the amount of funding it received. South Africa's structural challenges   As South Africa slowly opens up from one of the world's strictest lockdowns, unemployment is spiking and inequality is widening. A recent UNDP report estimates it will take at least five years to recover to pre-coronavirus levels of economic growth and employment. Vimal Ranchhod, an economics professor at the University of Cape Town, says skills development with the help of platforms like Giraffe is one way to assist young people. However, he cautions that it will be hard to address structural challenges in the labor market or education, many of which are tied to the country's apartheid past. ""Given the scale and nature of the problem, it requires a large-scale and long-term intervention from the government,"" he says. ""This does not mean that individual groups should not help if and when they can, because every little bit can help.""",cnn,"South Africa has the world's worst youth unemployment.

Celebrities gracing the 'green' carpet show Oscar-worthy sustainable dresses can still be glamorous,"Only just over a decade ago, sustainability in fashion was a fringe issue. But today, it has become a major talking point -- even at important red carpet events, as evidenced by this year's Oscars.  There, Joaquin Phoenix wore the same Stella McCartney tuxedo he had sported at the Golden Globes, Baftas and a number of other award shows this season in a bid to reduce waste. Saoirse Ronan appeared in a Gucci gown with a bodice made using the surplus fabric from her Baftas look. Costume designer Arianne Phillips was in an upcycled version of the Moschino dress she first wore at the 2012 Academy Awards. And that's just to name a few.  Red carpet awareness has been slowly bubbling over the past decade, thanks in part to future-forward initiatives asking celebrities to wear more environmentally-friendly designs at major events. In 2009, climate activist and former actress Suzy Amis Cameron launched the Red Carpet Green Dress (RCGD) campaign, which runs a contest for young and established designers to create garments according to strict sustainability criteria. One year later, Livia Firth, founder of consultancy Eco-Age, followed with her now global Green Carpet Challenge, which not only encourages celebrities to dress sustainably at events, but also works with fashion houses on innovative materials and techniques.  In recent years, celebrities, in collaboration with RCGD or Eco-Age, have turned up in gowns made of recycled materials or dead stock, showing they can make statements about sustainability and look good while doing it. Some of these looks -- as exemplified by Meryl Streep in Lanvin, Viola Davis in Valentino and Emma Watson in Calvin Klein -- showed the possibilities of recycled beverage containers. Watson's trouser-gown hybrid, which she wore to the 2016 Met Gala, was constructed using a yarn made entirely from used plastic bottles. Getting stars to make greener choices wasn't a straightforward process, according to Samata Pattinson, the CEO of Red Carpet Green Dress. Initially, ""it was really difficult to get talent on board with our campaign, because they had a limited view of what it would look like,"" she said in an email interview.  ""They were anxious, they didn't know if it would look good. The assumption was that it would be hemp, something 'granola.'""  But as awareness of fashion's devastating impact on the climate grows, so too does interest from celebrities. ""The red carpet is one of the biggest storytelling platforms there is, and an opportunity to change conversations,"" said Harriet Vocking, the chief brand officer of Eco-Age, discussing the Green Carpet Challenge in a phone interview. ""Wearing a sustainable garment (at award ceremonies) has become a way to lead by example, but also challenge the current fashion system."" To date, Eco-Age has worked with more than 250 celebrities to shine a light on sustainability, although Vocking, like Pattinson, also spoke of having to persuade people at first, ""as opposed to now, where we have incoming requests."" Vocking pinpointed Watson's Calvin Klein dress as a pivotal moment for the sustainable red carpet movement. ""Watson propelled the dialogue to new heights, because her gown was so well-received by everyone, and showed that the quality is there to make stunning and sustainable dresses,"" she explained. ""It moved the needle on how we see sustainable fashion."" The bigger picture Of course, there's only so much a red carpet dress can do in terms of tangible change. What's more, award shows themselves have a huge carbon footprint, with large amounts of energy required to stage them, and the waste left to be disposed of in their aftermath. Not to mention the air travel required of stars and their entourages. The process of dressing celebrities for the red carpet is undeniably wasteful too, with custom-made gowns and jewelry flown over, only to be worn once, feeding into fast-fashion's obsession with newness.  Neither green carpet initiative has shied away from these inconvenient truths. Rather, they've approached sustainability from different angles. ""In the beginning, we were really looking at certified materials and sustainable design solutions with dyes for example, but (our ethos) has grown to include wider conversations (from) refurbishing and repurposing, plant-based or vegan materials, and using recycled plastic, to circular design systems,"" Pattinson said. ""It's also grown to more visibly include a social justice element --  how we are treating people within this industry and how we treat the people who make our clothes."" Embracing vintage -- a trend harnessed by Penelope Cruz, Margot Robbie and Kim Kardashian West on this year's red carpets -- has become another way of cutting down on carbon emissions. Pattinson pointed to Emma Roberts' vintage Armani Prive dress for the 2017 Academy Awards as an example. ""Roberts' gown was important because it showed that, as much as we must look at new ways of making things sustainable, we still have to have a conversation about how there is so much beauty in what's already been made,"" she said.  Similarly, Eco-Age began its #30wears campaign, which invites shoppers to ask themselves whether they'll wear a piece of clothing at least 30 times, encouraging them to consider a garment's lifecycle and promoting a slower approach to fashion.  The consultancy has also challenged its own red carpet event -- the annual Green Fashion Awards, which honors fashion players committed to change in the sector's production chain -- to find other ways to reduce waste. These have included the use of recycled fishing nets for its red carpet, potted flowers that can be later donated or reused, and recycled film sets for its backdrops. ""Raising awareness works,"" Vocking said. ""But for positive impact to be real, every single step of the chain has to be taken into consideration.""

Retired top general who advised Trump is among nearly 500 national security experts endorsing Biden,"
                            A former senior military adviser to President Donald Trump has endorsed Joe Biden for president.    Retired Gen. Paul Selva, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of nearly 500 national security experts and former officials who signed a letter in support of Biden over Trump in an open letter to America. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Selva was re-nominated to the Joint Chiefs by Trump in 2017 after being first appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015. As vice chairman, he was deeply involved in the nation's nuclear weapons program, and his endorsement is especially notable because recently retired officers generally stay out of politics. ""Thanks to his disdainful attitude and his failures, our allies no longer trust or respect us, and our enemies no longer fear us. Climate change continues unabated, as does North Korea's nuclear program. The president has ceded influence to a Russian adversary who puts bounties on the heads of American military personnel, and his trade war against China has only harmed America's farmers and manufacturers,"" the letter reads.    It goes on to say, ""only FDR and Abraham Lincoln came into office facing more monumental crises than the next president."" Other signatories include retired four star general and former Army Vice Chief of Staff Peter Chiarelli and former State Department Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage, who served in the George W. Bush administration. The list also includes national security officials from Democratic administrations, like former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Rice, a co-chair of National Security Leaders for Biden, said Thursday that Trump has done damage to the US's global standing and that Biden would bolster America's national security.  ""They know that at a time when our standing globally has plummeted, when President Trump has denigrated the office of the presidency and made the United States a pariah in some respects on the world stage,  that we need a change, and we need a decisive change,"" Rice said of the national security experts and former officials who signed the letter at a VoteVets.org event.  Retired Rear Adm. Mike Smith, who organized the open letter, said at the event, ""It's time that we restore America's leadership, and that's what this letter is about.""  ""We came together really to send a message that the only option is to vote for Joe Biden in November. He has the leadership, he has integrity, he has the experience, he has the empathy that we need in the White House,"" Smith said. He said the letter was targeted toward undecided voters.  View 2020 presidential election polling In CNN's Jim Sciutto's book, ""The Madman Theory: Trump Takes on the World,"" a former senior official said Selva and other Pentagon officials were dumbfounded that the White House proposed direct military action into Iran when in September 2018 a handful of mortar shells struck near the US Embassy in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone causing no casualties or serious damage.

"What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, September 24","
                            The pandemic could have been the decisive moment in the fight against climate change -- an opportunity for leaders to bail out the environment and pivot the planet toward a greener future. Instead, CNN has found that some of the biggest fossil fuel-producing countries are injecting taxpayer money into propping up polluting industries. And exclusive new data shows these decisions are taking the world a step closer to a climate catastrophe. ""This is the one chance that we have,"" said professor Niklas Höhne, founding partner at the NewClimate Institute, a climate think tank, and co-author of an upcoming study from the Climate Action Tracker shared with CNN. The research shows that the world is running well behind its already insufficient targets of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The United Nations says it is necessary to phase out fossil fuels to stop catastrophic man-made climate change. But getting rid of them is going to be hard. Below, we look at four parts of the world once again turning to fossil fuels to help salvage their economies. YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED Q: Did coronavirus lockdowns put a lasting dent in our collective carbon footprint? A: The short answer: No. Global greenhouse gas emissions have fallen due to coronavirus lockdowns and current economic downturn means future emissions are projected to be slightly lower. But the recent decline won't have any real impact on long-term climate change, according to exclusive data from the Climate Action Tracker. Global emissions are still higher than nations promised under international agreements. And much higher than they need to be to limit catastrophic climate change. Send your questions here.

WHERE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CORONAVIRUS CONVERGE Poland is spending $35 million to buy up unwanted coal to relieve an industry ""shaken by the pandemic"" Civil engineer Piotr Pupin has been working at the Turów lignite mine in southwestern Poland for the past 19 years. And just like his father did, he hopes to continue working there until it's time to retire. He's got a problem. While the open pit mine holds enough coal to continue operations until 2044, its current permit is set to expire in just six years. And because of the climate crisis, there's plenty of opposition in the European Union to further extensions. But Poland is fiercely resisting the calls for a rapid phaseout of coal. The country is the only EU member state refusing to pledge carbon neutrality by 2050. And now, the Polish government is propping up the increasingly uneconomical industry by buying up unwanted coal and banning imports of cheaper coal. In Canada, the province of Alberta is investing $1.1 billion into a new oil pipeline, deemed ""essential"" for economic recovery Shawn ""Big John"" McDonald was born and raised on the Kikino Metis settlement in Alberta, a piece of land set aside for the local aboriginal population.  He got into the oil and gas industry straight after school. For McDonald, developing the area's oil sands is a logical continuation of his ancestors' traditions -- and a way to support the community's interests. The local government in Alberta agrees with McDonald. It is now pumping money into the oil and gas sector, hoping to speed up the recovery from the coronavirus crisis. It has invested 1.5 billion Canadian dollars ($1.1 billion) in the Keystone XL pipeline -- an investment it says will support the economy and create 7,000 jobs.  But critics of the choice say the decision to pour taxpayers' money into the project ignores the impacts of climate change already being experienced in Alberta, as well as Canada's commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Australia's Queensland is fast-tracking a new coal mine to help the state ""bounce back from the impacts of Covid-19"" There's a saying about Australians and coal: To find out what people think, you need to draw a horizontal line across the country, somewhere just north of Sydney. For those who live above the line, coal equals the economy and jobs. For those below it, it's all about climate change. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter after Indonesia, and Queensland in particular relies heavily on the resources sector.  When the economy suffered a major hit because of the pandemic this spring, the Queensland government quickly stepped in to provide relief for the all-important sector. The package included rent waivers, new exploration incentives and the capping and waiving of charges and fees. Then, in June, the state government decided to fast-track a new coal mine in the Bowen Basin, a 1.5 billion Australian dollar ($1.1 billion) project. Plans for the new mine have been met with criticism by climate groups, who say they make an ""absolute mockery"" of its pledges to limit coal mining because of climate change. India is opening up dozens of coal mines to the private sector to ""turn the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity"" The dense jungles of Hasdeo Arand, in India's central Chhattisgarh state, are home to endangered species and the Gondi, one of India's original indigenous tribes. It is also the site of an estimated 5 billion metric tons of coal, which the mining industry is keen to tap into. The Gondis' long fight to save the forest, and their way of life, from destruction has just gotten more complicated. With the aim of making India ""self-reliant,"" boosting the economy wrecked by the coronavirus pandemic and getting thousands of people back to work, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in June that 41 new ""coal blocks"" across five states would be opened up to commercial mining. While five sensitive mining locations in the Hasdeo Arand were eventually withdrawn from Modi's list, the threat to the forest hasn't subsided. And the push for more coal mining also has the potential to divert India from its global commitments to reduce emissions at a time where the country is reeling from extreme weather and water shortages linked to the climate crisis.

Federal officials are investigating utility equipment near the start of massive Bobcat Fire,"
                            Federal investigators looking into the origins of the massive Bobcat Fire are focusing on utility equipment owned by Southern California Edison (SCE) that experienced an issue moments before the fire was first reported. The fire, one of the largest wildfires in Los Angeles County history, started on September 6. It continues to burn in the mountains outside Los Angeles, torching more than 113,000 acres and sending a massive smoke plume over the region. The fire was about 39% contained Wednesday night, according to the Los Angeles County fire department. Edison spokesperson David Song told CNN the utility received a request from United States Forest Service (USFS) officials on September 15 to turn over a section of SCE's overhead conductor near Cogswell Dam. That's the area where the Bobcat Fire was sparked.  An incident report provided by Edison to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said an SCE circuit experienced a ""relay operation,"" which is like a circuit trip, at 12:16 p.m. on the day the fire started.  Five minutes later, at 12:21 p.m., a fire was first reported in the area. Song refuted any connection between the utility's equipment and the fire saying, ""The USFS said first reports of the fire were at 12:21pm. However, the Mt. Wilson camera first observed smoke at least as early as 12:10pm, prior to any activity on Edison's circuit."" Forest Service officials did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Fires still ravaging California  The thousands of wildfires that have charred 3.6 million acres of California land this year have killed 26 people since last month and destroyed more than 6,600 structures, fire officials say.  And at least 26 major wildfires continue to burn, with more than 18,200 firefighters battling the blazes.  Among the fires that are still active is the El Dorado Fire, which was sparked during a gender reveal party earlier this month. The fire has torched more than 22,000 acres and is now 74% contained.  In Northern California, the North Complex Fire has burned through more than a staggering 300,000 acres and is 78% contained. The fire has killed 15 people, according to CAL FIRE, and destroyed about 1,947 structures.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom has blamed the widespread blazes on climate change and on Wednesday, he issued an executive order requiring all new cars sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. ""This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""For too many decades, we have allowed cars to pollute the air that our children and families breathe. Californians shouldn't have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma."" ""Our cars shouldn't make wildfires worse -- and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn't melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.""

But firefighters had already extinguished several other fires, and some of the fire could have been a firefighting weapon.\n\nThe fire, known as a fireball, struck as it was beginning to clear the Bonny Canal Amphitheater around 4:30 p.m., according to the Interior Department. Officials then put down radar and moved firefighters to the top of the Bonny Canal Amphitheater.\n\n""The fire has been extinguished,"" an Interior spokeswoman said Saturday. The Bonny Canal Amphitheater is less than 10 miles south of Bonny and is on federal property east of the Bonny. The fire had been centered on Bonny Canyon and about 400 miles west in the south of the Bonny, the Interior spokeswoman said.\n\nSome officials have called for emergency response times to allow crews to quickly move out of their vehicles.\n\nThe Bonny Canal fire erupted in Bonny Canyon in February and continued for weeks. At the time, Bonny\'s fire officials called for a response, saying a fire was still raging at the time.\n\nMost residents said the fire had been largely contained. But some said local officials weren\'t ready to start to help yet.\n\n""This is a fire,"" said a resident of a nearby church. ""There are several fire stations and there are a lot of different fire types.""<|endoftext|>A federal judge could impose harsh new restrictions on businesses that own shares in U.S. mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets that are aimed at preventing brokers from selling on the open market.

Does the NFL know something that Trump doesn't?,"
                            If President Donald Trump's grievance-filled video rant to the UN General Assembly proved anything, it's that he doesn't really have a foreign policy. Trump lashed out at China and critics of his climate-change-denying environmental record, celebrated sparse diplomatic achievements and lied about the US fight against the pandemic. His speech encapsulated how he wields power abroad — in service of domestic and personal political goals, rather than based on a traditional calculation of wider US interests.  All Trump's foreign moves are expected to pull their political weight at home. When he wanted a trade deal with Beijing, Trump was Chinese President Xi Jinping's best friend — offering unwarranted praise over his pandemic leadership. But when his own disastrous handling of the virus threatened hopes of a second term, he chose China as a scapegoat even at the expense of triggering a new Cold War. The US pullout from the Iran nuclear deal left Tehran closer to a bomb, but it sure helped destroy Barack Obama's legacy. US-backed normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain also aimed to please evangelicals in the US. And while the President's love fest with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did nothing to dismantle his nukes, it yielded great photo ops. ""Only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for cooperation,"" Trump told the General Assembly, encapsulating his ""America First"" creed, which upends 80 years of US global leadership. If he loses the election in six weeks, his speech will be remembered as a defiant, valedictory swipe. And if Joe Biden takes Trump's place at the UN next year, he'll face a world grown skeptical of America's staying power -- and foes who made hay in its absence. 'Our own 1945 moment' Opening the day of leaders' speeches on Tuesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stuck a dark tone, calling the coronavirus pandemic and its effects ""our own 1945 moment"" -- a reference to the destruction of WWII. He also warned against the emerging US-China cold war, saying, ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture — each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities."" Monday Night Politics The NFL is hardly the most progressive organization in America. Yet the all-mighty football league has struck out in exactly the opposite direction to Trump on the pandemic and race -- suggesting that it thinks it understands something about the national moment that the President doesn't. Pigskin bosses just handed out $100,000 fines to three coaches for not wearing face masks on the sidelines. They also fined their teams, who are playing mostly without crowds -- unlike Trump in his campaign rallies. After shutting out Colin Kaepernick, who started a global movement by becoming the first player to take a knee to protest police brutality, the league has now taken a more accommodating view toward racial justice activism by players. One of the more reactionary teams, in Washington, has finally agreed that its previous Redskins branding is racially offensive.  With teams in more conservative areas, the NFL is sometimes caught between its players, who are disproportionately Black, and its fan base. Some of the few spectators allowed into games booed their own players over their demonstrations. Trump, meanwhile, is celebrating a dip in NFL ratings as proof that political correctness is ruining the country's most popular sport. Many of the teams' billionaire owners are conservative -- but if the league as a whole has any belief system, it's that they have an inalienable right to pile up billions of dollars in profits. The NFL, following the more inclusive NBA, NASCAR racing and other pro leagues, appears to have decided that its long-term business interests depend on being seen as open to the national reckoning on race. And if teams want to keep playing amid the pandemic, they can't skip protocols like social distancing and masks. Trump and the NFL have both shown an uncanny ability to read the public's mood. We'll soon see who was right.  Who said it? Every quote below was spoken by a different head of state at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. Write to meanwhile@cnn.com with your guess for each. ""We should see each other as members of the same big family, pursue win-win cooperation, and rise above ideological disputes and do not fall into the trap of 'clash of civilizations.' More importantly, we should respect a country's independent choice of development path and model.""
""The footage broadcast to the world concerning the treatment of an African American by the US police is reminiscent of our own experience. We instantly recognize that foot kneeling on the neck as the foot of arrogance on the neck of independent nations."" 
""here is no blood in the sand. Those days are hopefully over.""
""Geopolitical tensions continue to rise. Escalating tensions benefit no one. The new flashpoints heighten fears and tend to tear peoples apart. When elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled flat."" 
                        ",CNN.com,"{'output': ""Does the NFL know something that Trump doesn't? The NFL is the most popular team in the US and it's not a bad thing.\n\nThis, after all, is why the NFL is more popular than ever.\n\nBut I can't blame Trump for the league's success. He promised to put the game of baseball behind him. He promised to get rid of Goodell if he didn't care about the NFL.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen you compare the NFL numbers to what he did during the 2016 campaign, you'll notice that this is an NFL-wide comparison as opposed to what he did in the last election. I'll be comparing what we would expect in 2017, the year after the election. I'd say it takes about 70-90% of the league's games to win the presidency, it takes 10 years for a team to win the title, and it would take an eighth of the past 30 years (in terms of the amount of total games won, a new-ballot player's career is much longer than he's played) to win a league championship.\n\nI'm saying this after seeing all the media reports: The NBA was a little worse than the NFL in 2016 as soon as it launched, the same reason every other NFL football game is better. The NBA was a little worse when it launched, it wasn't even the NBA anymore. They were a little better after that, it didn't matter.\n\nAnd then this happens again, the same reason in the NBA. In 2017, in a few months we're going to have a new rule. This new rule may not help things but this will have a huge impact for the NBA. It will be a big-money thing and you will get a decent basketball team.\n\nSo if you take all this away, it's not like the league will give you anything. But if the league wanted to give you anything more, it will give you an NBA Finals basketball team in the postseason. I'm sure this would have a positive impact on it, but I believe that's too little-changed and this could easily be a reason for the league being in the 2018 Draft.\n\nI don't doubt this is a good thing for the NBA. It's a great organization, and it should be applauded, as well. A major issue here is for the NFL to win, not just in football but in general: the sport itself.\n\nIt's like this, because football is a great sport, and I think all the sports I love now, like baseball and basketball, are great. All the sports I loved in college and the country, and everything around me, have always been great. Football, just because it's not the way it's been portrayed in media, can still be a great sport.<|endoftext|>In May he met with several young gay activists who were arrested and detained by authorities who were trying to gather evidence, according to two Chicago police officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nThey were arrested a second time in early August to protest an ordinance that forbids police officers from arresting anyone they have arrested.\n\nPolice officers arrested their supporters — an activist, a pastor and a church leader — who had been attending protests outside the city's public library — and arrested several young gay activists before the mayor asked them to leave the building, the police official said as the group reached its final steps, including shutting down the library.\n\nPolice arrested five of the activists and confiscated five of their belongings and belongings, according to a police report.

Latest on 2020 election and SCOTUS battle,"
                            Vice President Mike Pence defended President Trump holding large rallies in an ABC News interview that airs Wednesday, saying it's happening because ""we're in an election year.""   ""President Trump and I trust the American people. We truly do believe in this freedom-loving nation that the American people know how to look after themselves, look after their families, and look after their neighbors and look out for the future of this country,"" he said. Asked by ABC if he's concerned about the optics of such events in the midst of a pandemic, Pence again said he believes that Americans can take care of themselves. ""The American people, really throughout the course of the last eight months, have demonstrated the ability to put the health of their family and their neighbors first,"" he said. The coronavirus pandemic has not subsided in the US, which has recorded more than 200,000 deaths from the virus.  On Amy Coney Barrett being a top contender for the SCOTUS job, Pence said, ""Judge Barrett is an extraordinary jurist. And she's among a number of women that are currently under consideration."" President Trump would not commit to saying he would provide a peaceful transition of power after Election Day.  “Well we’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster,” Trump said at a press briefing at the White House Wednesday evening.  “(G)et rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very … there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There’ll be a continuation,” he added. Trump said, “the ballots are out of control,” apparently referring to his unproven allegations that mail in ballots are somehow more vulnerable to fraud.  Facts First: While some sources estimate there will be around 80 million ballots submitted by mail this year, the President is wrong to suggest that they are all somehow unsolicited. In 41 of 50 states, voters have to request their ballot by mail before being sent one, with only a handful of states automatically sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters. There is no also factual basis for the claim that the left plans to use ""millions of fraudulent ballots"" or seeks to ""steal this election"" from Trump. The President himself has referred this week, also with no basis, to ""fake ballots."" Trump has made repeated false and misleading claims calling the integrity of the election into question.   Cindy McCain, the widow of longtime Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said Wednesday that lawmakers “working together civilly” is the only way for the US to move forward.  “Well, I think that there has been damage done,” McCain told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” when asked about President Trump’s effect on the Republican Party.  “But I believe in the great spirit of the United States of America and I think those things can be mended and healed. What has been missing here is this divisive attitude toward right and wrong on Capitol Hill. In many cases nobody is right or wrong, it is just a matter of opinion. And working together civilly is the only way that we can handle this.” Her comments come one day after she formally endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for president.  “I remember John as a young congressman working across the aisle with Tip O'Neill. They didn't agree on much of anything at all but the two of them remained friends because they respected each other and believed that they were doing it for the good of the country.”  “And that is the same with Joe Biden,” she added.  President Trump said he thinks it’s important to have nine Supreme Court justices prior to the election because the results of the election could wind up before the court. The President is expected to announce his nominee this Saturday.   “Yes, I think it’s very important. I think this will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it’s very important that we have nine justices,” Trump said on Wednesday. Trump said there is a lot of time to confirm a new justice to the high court since his term goes until January 20, “but I think it’s better if you go before the election because I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling, it’s a scam, this scam will be before the United States Supreme Court and I think having a four-four situation is not a good situation if you get that.”   Trump was referring to unsolicited ballots being sent to Americans which he mentioned earlier in his remarks. “I think it should be eight-nothing or nine-nothing, but just in case it would be more political than it should be, I think it’s very important to have a ninth justice,” Trump added. Of note, there were only eight justices at the time of the 2016 election. Trump said he’s confident that the Senate can confirm a new justice before November 3, noting that many of his potential nominees “just went through the process recently” for other judicial appointments. “I think the process is going to go very quickly. The hearing, I think Lindsey is going to call the date of the hearing… You can’t call it until you have the candidate and once you have the nominee, I will wait to hear what the date is, but from that point I would think we’d be fairly quick,” he said. Trump said most of the Republican senators have already made their intentions known on voting for a Supreme Court nominee. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also said there should be a vote on a new Supreme Court nominee before the election.  ##SCOTUS## Upset by the fact that they didn’t have prom as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and eager to mobilize around the 2020 election, a group of young organizers decided to link prom and voting. Youth organizers launched “Prom at the Polls” Tuesday, a nonpartisan initiative to energize young voters and inspire them to turnout on or ahead of November 3. The initiative encourages young people to make a “prom-poll-sal,” which organizers describe as “the action of asking someone to go to prom at the polls with you” and posting it to social media.  After making their “prom-poll-sal,” participants are encouraged to dress up as if they are going to prom when they cast their ballot – either by mail or in person – and document it on social media. Prom at the Polls, which launched on National Voter Registration Day, will host a livestream event on November 1, inviting voters and their dates to attend a pseudo-prom party.  The founding organizers of Prom at the Polls include a group of young activists who advocate for a number of issues voting rights, climate justice, immigration reform, and gun violence prevention.  The initiative’s organizers are Jerome Foster II, Randi Garcia, Santiago Mayer, Sophia Shapiro and Matthew Weinstein, who are all between the ages of 18 and 25. They were introduced by actress Alyssa Milano on September 8, organizers said, and immediately started to brainstorm ways to get out the youth vote. That led to Prom at the Polls. Milano, a leading activist in the #MeToo movement, is an advocate on a number of social issues.  “Voting is how we protect each other. I am so proud of this younger generation. They understand the importance of civic engagement and they are using their voices to inspire other young people to find their voices too,” Milano said in a statement Tuesday. Organizers bonded over the fact that they didn’t have prom this year, Jerome Foster, 18 and a freshman at Pace University, told CNN.  “We wanted to create an event that brings hope and joy to voting,” Foster said.  While there was high youth voter turnout in the 2018 midterms , Foster noted that not all registered voters hit the polls. He hopes Prom at the Polls will help maintain excitement between National Voter Registration Day and Election Day, ensuring that registered voters turn out in the 2020 election. Prom at the Polls is in talks to team up with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, as well as a number of celebrities and influencers who will help promote the initiative, Weinstein, 20, told CNN.  Vote.org will track the number of participants who register to vote as a result of the initiative. ""The youth vote comprises a significant portion of this year's electorate, and it is essential that these voices are heard,"" Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey said. ##Voting## Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made his first trip to North Carolina as the Democratic presidential nominee Wednesday afternoon, holding an ""economic summit"" in Charlotte with Black small business owners, educators, and working people. Wearing Ray-Bans as he kicked off remarks and carrying a white notecard he occasionally referenced, Biden introduced himself, joking “I’m Joe Biden, and I’m trying to get a job with Chris,” referring to NBA star Chris Paul, who introduced the former vice president.  Biden took issue with President Trump’s remarks that the virus affects “virtually nobody,” asking the audience to consider, “So you go home and your mom's gone, your dad's gone. He's a virtual nobody?”  Biden said that while the virus wasn’t Trump’s fault, his handling of it has “been close to criminal.” He addressed the systemic racism that has caused racial inequities, saying that “we have to break the cycle.”  “What I want to talk to you about today is that you know we have to break a cycle. The cycle that exists is that the African American community by and large finds itself at the bottom of the economic heap when businesses and others, when things are good. When things get bad, they're the first ones in the hole. When things get better, they're the last ones out,” he said.  He said the American people have finally seen the injustice as a result of the pandemic. “But the American people have all of a sudden, average people gone, ""My Lord, Holy-mackerel, I didn't know it was this bad."" A lot of them didn't know. A lot did. But a lot did know it was this bad,” he said.  Biden implored people to get out and vote. “The point is I believe we have a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity to fundamentally change the systemic racism and systemic problems that exist in our system. And I think we have to do it. But only one way to do it. We've got to show up and vote,” he said.  It takes 270 electoral votes to win the 2020 presidential election. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is campaigning today in the battleground state of North Carolina as Election Day quickly approaches.  CNN's John King breaks down the latest polls and where the candidates stand in their race to 270: Vice President Mike Pence and other federal health officials sought to impress upon governors Monday the importance of boosting confidence in an eventual coronavirus vaccine as President Trump continues to suggest one will be available before the election. Speaking on a weekly conference call, Pence acknowledged the fraught political climate but said the vaccine conversation should be viewed separately — though Trump himself has publicly floated the possibility a vaccine is available before Election Day.  ""I know we’re in an election season. Just as I have over the last seven or eight months, I’m leaving the politics outside,"" Pence said on the call. ""We are working around the clock to get a safe and effective vaccine available for the American people but what we need is two things: number one, we need you to be ready to distribute it. Number two, we need you to do your part to build public confidence that it will be a safe and effective vaccine. What we don’t want is people undermining confidence in the process,"" he went on. Polls have shown the number of Americans willing to take a vaccine once it is available declining. A survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation in September found a majority of Americans, 62%, believe political pressure from the Trump administration will cause the US Food and Drug Administration to rush approval of a coronavirus vaccine before Election Day. Pence sought to dispel those concerns with governors — ""No corners are going to be cut, ever,"" he said — and asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease specialist, to lay out the vaccine approval process. Some background: Fauci said multiple advisory panels would be consulted before a vaccine is approved, either for emergency use or a broader approval, and said all the scientific data would be made available for independent review. ""When we say that we feel confident that the process that has been put in place traditionally for making decisions as to the safety and efficacy of a vaccine are in place — and that’s the reason why I have said publicly that I feel confident,"" Fauci said. Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reiterated the appeal to governors to use their platforms to boost confidence in a vaccine. ""I don’t believe that access to the vaccine after the first of the year and into the beginning of the second quarter would be an issue,"" he said, ""but I am concerned, as the vice president stressed, about building public confidence."" ""Our biggest challenge, and what I would ask the leadership of each of you have, is to build that culture of confidence in vaccination,"" he said. ""Once doubt sets in, it’s going to be very hard for us to reverse that in different populations."" ##Coronavirus## Two Republicans in Minnesota, with the support of the Honest Elections Project, are suing the state for extending the deadline for absentee ballots to be received amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In August, a judge in Minnesota approved changes eliminating the state’s requirement that voters get a notary or witness to sign their ballot envelope, and allows for absentee ballots to be counted if they are postmarked on or before Election Day and received by 8 p.m. within one week of Election Day. The previous rule was that ballots had to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Honest Elections Project said in a news release that this change “puts the credibility of the election in jeopardy, and violates the law,” and the group calls out other swing states that have already taken this action as well. “Liberal groups are looking to repeat this strategy in other battleground states. Already, courts have rewritten ballot receipt laws in Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” the release said. Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, called this change in Minnesota “a senseless recipe for disaster.” The suit, filed Tuesday in Minnesota Federal Court, asks for injunctions that would prevent ballots received after Election Day from being counted. “This plan will cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election’s results, and force litigation that could drag on for weeks. If Minnesota cannot certify its election results by December, it may be excluded from the Electoral College—disenfranchising the entire state. In other words, this is a senseless recipe for disaster,” Snead said. The two plaintiffs in the case are nominees to be Republican Party electors for Minnesota. Some background: CNN previously reported that the Honest Elections Project is a nonprofit group tied to influential conservatives who worked closely with PresidentTrump to elevate two Supreme Court justices.  It is pushing key states to “clean up” their voting rolls — a practice voting-rights groups and Democrats argue seeks to ""purge"" legitimate voters. The group is supporting a lawsuit against Michigan — where Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes -- that claims the state has an ""impossibly high"" high voter registration rate.  Understanding mail-in voting in the US ##Voting## Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that he will start preparing ""heavily"" for the debates beginning tomorrow. The first presidential debate is set to take place next Tuesday.  Speaking to reporters about the Supreme Court vacancy before boarding his flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, this morning, Biden said that Democrats need to ""make it clear"" what will happen if the Republican nominee for Ginsburg replacement is confirmed, listing threats to women's health care rights and the Affordable Care Act.  ""We should be out there campaigning on what’s going to happen,"" he said. ""Women will be able to be charged more than men for the same procedures again. Pregnancy will be a pre-existing condition again. We’ve got to go to the American people and make the case why this is a gigantic mistake and abuse of power.” On China, a nation Biden called a ""competitor"" during CNN's town hall, the Democratic presidential nominee said that he does not believe that relations will be ""zero-sum,"" and added that he does intend call out China's human rights violations and militarization of the South China Sea.  President Barack Obama on Wednesday urged Americans to text him with their plans to vote in the upcoming election.  In a tweet, Obama listed a phone number and said: ""All right, let's try something new. If you’re in the United States, send me a text at 773-365-9687 — I want to hear how you're doing, what's on your mind, and how you're planning on voting this year. I'll be in touch from time to time to share what's on my mind, too.” Sending a text message to the phone number results in an automated response from Obama, as well as a hyperlink to Community, a text message-based social network. ""Hey! It's Barack,” the response says. ""Click the link to sign up so I can respond directly to you. I won't be able to get to everything, but I'll be in touch to share what's on my mind and I want to hear from you, too. Let's do this."" Fast Company reported Wednesday that Obama and his team are using Community to energize voters — part of a wider effort to reach Americans on as many platforms as possible.  Community’s website lists celebrities such as Jared Leto and Alyssa Milano as verified users.  See Obama's tweet:  ##Voting##  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden joined The Steve Harvey Morning Show Wednesday for a wide-ranging interview touching on the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the vacancy in the Supreme Court, his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and his plan for Black Americans.  Biden, who made a direct plea to Republican senators to listen to their conscience in remarks Sunday, said that Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski ""had the guts"" to announce that the nomination of Ginsburg's replacement should wait until the election is over.  ""There's two people who have announced, who had the guts to announce that they will wait for election is over and shouldn’t vote then, and that is the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Maine and both women,"" Biden said. ""But there's a couple of others, if two others stand up and do the right thing, then it’ll be put off until the election.""  He said that rushing a nomination is a ""fundamental violation of the constitutional principal."" Asked by Harvey if it is ""legal"" for the President to appoint someone, Biden replied that Trump can legally appoint someone (""it's his right, technically""), but added that ""it’s a violation of the constitutional – under the underlying rationale – he can name somebody he wants to be the nominee but all those Republicans including the Majority Leader McConnell from Kentucky said that you shouldn't appoint anybody in an election year.""  On his and Sen. Harris' plan for Black Americans, Biden reiterated the crux of his plan, which is the importance of putting Black men and women in a position where they are able to accumulate wealth. ""Where they are in a position where they can begin to actually have the place in the community where as a people across the board, they grow the middle class,"" he said.  Biden praised Harris as his running mate and said that she would be ready to assume the presidency if anything were to happen to him.  ""She is so good. She is so good. She’s so damn bright and knowledgeable. I mean she’s ready to be president on day one if I – if somebody pushed me off a roof or something,"" he said.  Asked how to combat voter suppression, Biden encouraged listeners to visit ""iwillvote.com"" as a resource and warned that the administration will do ""everything in their power"" to keep people from voting, ""but they're not going to be stopped.""  ""The top line is: people in this country are going to be heard, no matter how much the President tries to stop them,"" Biden said. ""The African American people can determine this election.""  There’s nothing new about voting by mail. Americans have been doing it since the Civil War, and many states primarily vote by mail to this day.  But this year, Covid-19 is pushing many states to expand those efforts.

McCain said that she is hoping to reach suburban women who may be on the fence with her voice.  In an interview on NBC’s Today Show, McCain said his empathy played a key factor in her decision to support the Democratic presidential nominee. “I want to feel like my president cares about me and cares about my country and Joe Biden does,” she said, later adding “Joe has great empathy for people in this country.”  McCain, who narrated a video about her husband and Biden’s friendship for the DNC, said the Atlantic report on President Trump’s denigrating comments about veterans and those killed in battle was “pretty much” the last straw for her when making the decision to endorse. “It’s a combination of things, but I do believe that our men and women that served in the military are not losers and certainly the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice are not losers,” she said. “I think that respect for the men and women who serve us and served this nation and protect us it’s important that we respect and care for them.” Asked if she’s disappointed in Lindsey Graham and other Republicans in their ardent support of Trump, she said “No. Lindsey is an old and very dear friend and I will always love him and he’s like a member of my family. Republicans that are – that believe and are doing what they’re doing, it’s certainly their prerogative to do so, I just believe things should be different.”  McCain said she hopes her husband is “happy with what I’m doing and believes that I’ve done the right thing.” She told ABC's Good Morning America that she intends to be actively campaigning. ""Yes, yes, of course. I'm hoping that I can convince suburban women who are kind of on the fence about things to come with me on this and step by step out of their comfort zone and join Team Biden,"" she said.  McCain, a lifelong Republican, said on ABC that while she and Biden disagree on some issues, that ""it's ok to disagree, and you can do it and be amenable and kind to each other,"" likening it to the friendship Biden had with her late husband.  Watch:  During a Good Morning America interview on Wednesday, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams advised the public to wear masks, in response to being asked about President  Trump's packed rally last night.  ""I've got Democrats who want me to condemn people who are out at a presidential rally. I've got Republicans who want me to condemn people who are going to vigils. And at the end of the day, the virus doesn't care about your politics,"" Adams said. ""It doesn't care what you're going out for. It only cares whether or not you're following public health measures. So, what I would say to everyone, politics aside: Wear a mask."" When asked why Americans are increasingly skeptical of a coronavirus vaccine, Adams said it’s because the situation has become politicized. ""I think it's become politicized. And it's important for people to understand we have a process. We have a data safety monitoring board. We have institutional review boards. We have independent people who are going to look at safety and efficacy before it ever gets to the point of approval or authorization. And I will be in line to get that vaccine when they tell me I can, and when it's safe and it's effective,"" Adams said.  ##Coronavirus## We're now less than 45 days until the election, so it shouldn't surprise you that we're talking about the state of Florida. The Sunshine State has arguably been the swingiest of the swing states over the last 25 years. This year, however, Florida looks to take on added importance. The outcome in Florida could help determine whether Election Night turns into Election Week or even potentially Election Month. A record number of voters are expected to vote by absentee or mail this year. About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they'll be voting by mail, up from about a quarter in 2016. Fewer than 25% of Republicans say they'll cast a ballot by mail. This wide gap is no doubt driven in part by President Donald Trump's largely false rhetoric about voting by mail. In Florida, this gap in voting style won't make much of a difference in terms of when we know the winner. All ballots, with just a few exceptions, must be received at poll closing time by the county boards of elections. Those ballots are usually counted before those cast on Election Day. The state also has a long history of voting by mail. About 30% of the vote in 2016 was cast by mail. As long as the vote is not exceedingly tight in Florida, we'll have a good indication of who has won the Sunshine State on Election Night. If we know who has won in Florida, we'll have a good idea of what to expect from the rest of the country. At this point, former Vice President Joe Biden holds a slim polling lead there. As I've noted before, Florida has voted with the winner in every election since 1996 and all but two since 1924. In both those cases, it was Democrats who took the presidency without Florida. This year, it's pretty clear that Trump has very few paths to the White House without winning Florida. It's possible, but it isn't really realistic. Read the full analysis here.  Multiple sources familiar tell CNN that both the White House and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham are targeting the week of Oct. 12 for the nominee’s confirmation hearing.  That would allow for a confirmation vote by Oct. 29, hitting a pre-election timeline that the White House and congressional Republicans are increasingly coalescing behind.  Plans have not been finalized and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not laid out an explicit timeline to this point. But sources say he’s involved in the conversations and hasn’t objected to the prospect of a pre-election conformation.  The Supreme Court term starts on Oct. 5 and some big cases are scheduled for the fall, including oral arguments on the Affordable Care Act on Nov. 10.   ##SCOTUS## The first presidential debate between Joe Biden and President Trump will be moderated by Fox News' Chris Wallace and is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. Wallace selected the following topics for the first debate, according to the Commission on Presidential Debate: ""The Trump and Biden Records"" 
""The Supreme Court,"" ""Covid-19"" 
""The Economy,"" ""Race and Violence in our Cities"" 
""The Integrity of the Election"" Each segment will last about 15 minutes, and the candidates will have two minutes to respond after the moderator opens each segment with a question.  Wallace will then use the rest of the time in the segment to facilitate further discussion on the topic, according to the commission. Read more about the scheduled debates here.

California governor wants all new cars sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035,"
                            California Governor Gavin Newsom announced an executive order Wednesday requiring that all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.  The effort is aimed at curbing carbon emissions in the country's most populous state and addressing the climate change crisis. The transportation sector is responsible for more than half of the state's carbon pollution, according to Newsom's office.  The announcement comes after Californians have for weeks been battered by an unprecedented wildfire season. The vast majority of scientists agree that climate change-driven disasters will inevitably increase.  ""This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,"" Newsom said in a release. ""Californians shouldn't have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma. Our cars shouldn't make wildfires worse — and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn't melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines."" The order relates only to new car sales. It would not prevent Californians from owning or driving gasoline-powered cars, or buying or selling them on the used car market, according to the release.  It's unclear exactly how the order will be implemented. Following the order, the California Air Resources Board has been charged with developing new regulations mandating that all in-state sales of passenger cars and trucks be zero-emission by 2035. The board is also developing regulations that would require all medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to go emissions-free by 2045 ""where feasible,"" though the mandate stays at 2035 for harbor shipping operations vehicles.  In order for the mandate to be carried out, the release said California state agencies will partner with the private sector to develop the infrastructure to support what would likely amount to more widespread usage of electric vehicles, such as more charging stations throughout the state.  The order is a bold move that would follow the lead of several cities and countries around the world. California would be the US state to implement such a policy.  But it's likely to be unpopular with at least some auto manufacturers — the switch to widespread production of all-electric vehicles, while already underway for most major manufacturers, is costly — and they could could challenge the order in court.  Then again, the order could be just the kind of push needed to get the auto industry moving more aggressively toward a strategy centered on electric vehicles, according to Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds, an online resource for car data. ""The automotive industry was already on the road toward electrification as a long term goal, but many automakers have been guilty of setting short term targets for their electrification strategy that never came to fruition,"" Caldwell said in an emailed comment. ""This rule, if implemented, establishes a specific timeline that they'll collectively need to adhere to. California is a major market that automakers desperately need to maintain sales within to ensure their own viability."" Newsom's order also comes in the midst of California's court battle with the Trump administration over the state's ability to set its own emissions standards, which could be another hurdle for the order's implementation.  There is also a question of affordability and equity for low-income communities, as electric cars tend to be more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts, at least for now. The governor's press release announcing the order noted that, ""zero-emission vehicles will almost certainly be cheaper and better than the traditional fossil fuel powered cars"" by the time the rule goes into effect.  In a press conference about the order Wednesday, Newsom's staff also pointed to private sector developments, such as a prediction by Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tuesday that more efficient batteries will be mainstream in the next three to four years, which would significantly reduce the costs of electric vehicles.

Hickenlooper attacks Gardner over Supreme Court vacancy in Colorado Senate race,"
                            Former Gov. John Hickenlooper attacked Sen. Cory Gardner in a new ad released Wednesday, charging that the Colorado Republican is ""ready to rush through a Supreme Court justice at lightning speed"" rather than address a host of other issues. The ad is one of the first in the country to invoke the fight over Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's successor, underscoring how Democrats view the vacancy as a political winner in blue states, where the party base is furious at Republicans for moving forward to confirm a nominee and shift the Court even further to the right. ""Cory Gardner has taken no action to lower health care costs, lower prescription drug prices, rebuild our infrastructure, fight climate change or provide economic relief in this pandemic for five months,"" says Hickenlooper in the ad. ""But boy oh boy, Cory is ready to rush through a Supreme Court justice at lightning speed."" ""The next court will decide whether to rip up protections for people with pre-existing conditions, whether women still have a right to choose, and really what justice means in this country,"" he adds. Gardner is one of the most vulnerable Republican senators in the country, running in a state that went for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by five points in the 2016 presidential race. His campaign did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. It's a Tilt Democratic race, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.   In March 2016, Gardner, like almost every other Republican senator, supported blocking then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, from filling the seat left by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. ""Our next election is too soon and the stakes are too high; the American people deserve a role in this process as the next Supreme Court Justice will influence the direction of this country for years to come,"" he said at the time. After Ginsburg's death on Friday, the Colorado senator quickly backed the Senate Republican strategy to consider Trump's to-be-announced nominee to replace her even though Election Day is less than six weeks away. ""I have and will continue to support judicial nominees who will protect our Constitution, not legislate from the bench, and uphold the law,"" said Gardner in a statement earlier this week. ""Should a qualified nominee who meets this criteria be put forward, I will vote to confirm."" It's unclear exactly how the vacancy will affect the fight for control of the Senate. Democrats are confident that it will help them in blue states like Colorado and Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins faces a tough reelection race, while Republicans are confident it will help them in red states like Montana. If Sen. Doug Jones loses in deep red Alabama, Democrats needs to win four seats and the White House to take control of the chamber.  Democratic Senate candidates including Hickenlooper have advocated for fulfilling Ginsburg's ""most fervent wish"" to not be replaced until after the next presidential inauguration, when a President Joe Biden could choose her replacement. Democrats have no power to block a nearly unified Senate Republican majority, but are warning voters that a Supreme Court with six conservative justices could dismantle the Affordable Care Act and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The Court hears a crucial case on the law's constitutionality a week after Election Day. Gardner has defended himself from attacks over his support to repeal the ACA, saying in an ad that he'll protect people with pre-existing conditions like his mother, ""no matter what happens to Obamacare."" His campaign also aired a new ad on Wednesday, referencing an infamous ad Hickenlooper ran in 2010, in which the Democrat took a shower with his clothes on because he couldn't stand all the negative ads. ""Now, it's Hickenlooper who's running nasty ads,"" says Gardner in his ad, as he leaves a shower wearing a blue shirt and tie. ""You and I may not always agree, but I stay true and work hard for Colorado.

Leaders spar at UN General Assembly amid global crisis,"
                            World leaders gathered virtually Tuesday for this week's United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), with the UN's historic 75th anniversary overshadowed by strongmen leaders, fraying relations and a sense of intensifying international crisis.  The summit was forced online this year due to the pandemic and the 14-day quarantine regulations in New York City.  Covid-19 loomed heavily over the first day of the event. Instead of meeting in person, UN officials, presidents and prime ministers sent pre-recorded speeches to mark the occasion. US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, and a suite of strongmen including China's Xi Jinping, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and Russia's Vladimir Putin all spoke early on Tuesday.  UN Secretary General António Guterres called the health crisis ""our own 1945 moment"" -- a reference to World War II -- and described Covid-19 as ""a toxic virus shaking the democratic underpinnings in many countries."" Guterres' remarks touched on rising global poverty and fractured diplomatic relations, and warned of the increasingly bitter standoff between the China and the United States, whose diplomatic relationship he said was moving ""in a very dangerous direction."" ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture — each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities,"" he said. Guterres also suggested a New Global Deal to solve the crisis, built on a multilateral approach.  But Tuesday's session often highlighted a lack of unity between UN members, with tensions particularly apparent between the US and China. Trump praised his own handling of the pandemic in the US, and touted his role in facilitating peace agreements between the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Israel, saying that more peace agreements would be coming shortly. He used part of his time to attack China, calling the coronavirus the ""China virus"" and urging the UN to hold Beijing accountable for the pandemic. He accused Beijing of ""allowing flights to leave China and infect the world"" and of ""virtually controlling"" the World Health Organization. WHO Communications director Gabby Stern responded on Twitter, writing, ""@WHO has 194 Member States; no one gov't controls us."" In a direct challenge to multilateralism, the US President also said global leaders should each put their own countries first. ""For decades the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people, but only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for cooperation,"" Trump said.  He added, ""As president, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past, and I am proudly putting America first, just as you should be putting your countries first. That's okay. That's what you should be doing."" Speaking right after President Xi's pre-recorded message,  China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jan rejected Trump's ""baseless accusations."" Later at the Chinese Mission in New York, he described the US handing of the pandemic as ""a complete failure"" and said that China would formally reply to Trump's accusations later in the week. Xi, for his part, pointedly expressed his country's commitment to pursuing ""open and inclusive development,"" to building an open world economy, and upholding the multilateral trading regime ""with the WTO as the cornerstone."" ""We should say no to unilateralism and protectionism,"" Xi said. Xi also announced that China aims to see CO2 emissions ""peak"" before 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.  In contrast to Trump, Russia's Putin praised the UN, saying that over the decades it had ""been ably fulfilling its mission of protecting peace, promoting sustainable development of the peoples and continents and providing assistance in mitigating local crises.""  ""This enormous potential and expertise of the UN is relevant and serves as a solid basis for moving ahead,"" he said. Meanwhile, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro used his message to accuse foreign agents of overhyping fires in the Amazon. Flames are currently raging in the Amazon for a second consecutive year, and deforestation has increased since Bolsonaro took office. ""We are victims of the most brutal misinformation campaign about the Amazon and the Brazilian wetlands,"" Bolsonaro said. Another clash, this time in Europe, took center stage when Turkey's Erdogan spoke. The Turkish leader called for a regional conference to address tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean between Turkey and Greece, and accused Greece of causing problems in the region. Avoid 'vaccinationalism,' UN pleads Vaccines were also on several leaders' minds, after Guterres' opening address urged UN member states to avoid nationalism when it comes to curbing the pandemic. Several leaders touted their country's vaccine candidates as a potential solution. Putin said the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine was ""reliable, safe and effective."" Moscow drew criticism when it approved Sputnik V earlier this summer before conducting Phase 3 clinical trials.  Ha added that he would be wiling to provide the vaccine to UN staffers. ""Russia is ready to provide the UN with all the necessary qualified assistance; in particular, we are offering to provide our vaccine, free of charge, for the voluntary vaccination of the staff of the UN and its offices,"" he said. China's Xi said Beijing's vaccines would be a ""global public good"" once developed and noted that there were several in Phase 3 clinical trials. He added that if a vaccine was developed, it would be ""provided to other developing countries on a priority basis.""  Though national leaders stayed home, the UN's iconic Assembly Hall was not entirely empty this week -- one diplomat per country is allowed to introduce their leader's speech. On the sidelines, largely virtual meetings will also take place on topics including climate change, biodiversity, and Lebanon.

Retired top general who advised Trump is among nearly 500 national security experts endorsing Biden,"
                            A former senior military adviser to President Donald Trump has endorsed Joe Biden for president.    Retired Gen. Paul Selva, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of nearly 500 national security experts and former officials who signed a letter in support of Biden over Trump in an open letter to America. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Selva was re-nominated to the Joint Chiefs by Trump in 2017 after being first appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015. As vice chairman, he was deeply involved in the nation's nuclear weapons program, and his endorsement is especially notable because recently retired officers generally stay out of politics. ""Thanks to his disdainful attitude and his failures, our allies no longer trust or respect us, and our enemies no longer fear us. Climate change continues unabated, as does North Korea's nuclear program. The president has ceded influence to a Russian adversary who puts bounties on the heads of American military personnel, and his trade war against China has only harmed America's farmers and manufacturers,"" the letter reads.    It goes on to say, ""only FDR and Abraham Lincoln came into office facing more monumental crises than the next president."" Other signatories include retired four star general and former Army Vice Chief of Staff Peter Chiarelli and former State Department Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage, who served in the George W. Bush administration. The list also includes national security officials from Democratic administrations, like former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Rice, a co-chair of National Security Leaders for Biden, said Thursday that Trump has done damage to the US's global standing and that Biden would bolster America's national security.  ""They know that at a time when our standing globally has plummeted, when President Trump has denigrated the office of the presidency and made the United States a pariah in some respects on the world stage,  that we need a change, and we need a decisive change,"" Rice said of the national security experts and former officials who signed the letter at a VoteVets.org event.  Retired Rear Adm. Mike Smith, who organized the open letter, said at the event, ""It's time that we restore America's leadership, and that's what this letter is about.""  ""We came together really to send a message that the only option is to vote for Joe Biden in November. He has the leadership, he has integrity, he has the experience, he has the empathy that we need in the White House,"" Smith said. He said the letter was targeted toward undecided voters.  View 2020 presidential election polling In CNN's Jim Sciutto's book, ""The Madman Theory: Trump Takes on the World,"" a former senior official said Selva and other Pentagon officials were dumbfounded that the White House proposed direct military action into Iran when in September 2018 a handful of mortar shells struck near the US Embassy in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone causing no casualties or serious damage.

The source added that Biden, along with other members of the Obama administration, told the president he was considering a role in the talks on Iran, but he felt ""there hasn\'t been the political or cooperative leadership at the United Nations that this would be helpful for,"" according to a source.

The key message of this meeting, as well as Biden\'s previous comments to CNN, was that Obama is in the waning days of his presidency. ""He understands that diplomacy and diplomacy move at a breakneck pace right now,"" the source said.

"What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, September 24","
                            The pandemic could have been the decisive moment in the fight against climate change -- an opportunity for leaders to bail out the environment and pivot the planet toward a greener future. Instead, CNN has found that some of the biggest fossil fuel-producing countries are injecting taxpayer money into propping up polluting industries. And exclusive new data shows these decisions are taking the world a step closer to a climate catastrophe. ""This is the one chance that we have,"" said professor Niklas Höhne, founding partner at the NewClimate Institute, a climate think tank, and co-author of an upcoming study from the Climate Action Tracker shared with CNN. The research shows that the world is running well behind its already insufficient targets of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The United Nations says it is necessary to phase out fossil fuels to stop catastrophic man-made climate change. But getting rid of them is going to be hard. Below, we look at four parts of the world once again turning to fossil fuels to help salvage their economies. YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED Q: Did coronavirus lockdowns put a lasting dent in our collective carbon footprint? A: The short answer: No. Global greenhouse gas emissions have fallen due to coronavirus lockdowns and current economic downturn means future emissions are projected to be slightly lower. But the recent decline won't have any real impact on long-term climate change, according to exclusive data from the Climate Action Tracker. Global emissions are still higher than nations promised under international agreements. And much higher than they need to be to limit catastrophic climate change. Send your questions here.

WHERE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CORONAVIRUS CONVERGE Poland is spending $35 million to buy up unwanted coal to relieve an industry ""shaken by the pandemic"" Civil engineer Piotr Pupin has been working at the Turów lignite mine in southwestern Poland for the past 19 years. And just like his father did, he hopes to continue working there until it's time to retire. He's got a problem. While the open pit mine holds enough coal to continue operations until 2044, its current permit is set to expire in just six years. And because of the climate crisis, there's plenty of opposition in the European Union to further extensions. But Poland is fiercely resisting the calls for a rapid phaseout of coal. The country is the only EU member state refusing to pledge carbon neutrality by 2050. And now, the Polish government is propping up the increasingly uneconomical industry by buying up unwanted coal and banning imports of cheaper coal. In Canada, the province of Alberta is investing $1.1 billion into a new oil pipeline, deemed ""essential"" for economic recovery Shawn ""Big John"" McDonald was born and raised on the Kikino Metis settlement in Alberta, a piece of land set aside for the local aboriginal population.  He got into the oil and gas industry straight after school. For McDonald, developing the area's oil sands is a logical continuation of his ancestors' traditions -- and a way to support the community's interests. The local government in Alberta agrees with McDonald. It is now pumping money into the oil and gas sector, hoping to speed up the recovery from the coronavirus crisis. It has invested 1.5 billion Canadian dollars ($1.1 billion) in the Keystone XL pipeline -- an investment it says will support the economy and create 7,000 jobs.  But critics of the choice say the decision to pour taxpayers' money into the project ignores the impacts of climate change already being experienced in Alberta, as well as Canada's commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Australia's Queensland is fast-tracking a new coal mine to help the state ""bounce back from the impacts of Covid-19"" There's a saying about Australians and coal: To find out what people think, you need to draw a horizontal line across the country, somewhere just north of Sydney. For those who live above the line, coal equals the economy and jobs. For those below it, it's all about climate change. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter after Indonesia, and Queensland in particular relies heavily on the resources sector.  When the economy suffered a major hit because of the pandemic this spring, the Queensland government quickly stepped in to provide relief for the all-important sector. The package included rent waivers, new exploration incentives and the capping and waiving of charges and fees. Then, in June, the state government decided to fast-track a new coal mine in the Bowen Basin, a 1.5 billion Australian dollar ($1.1 billion) project. Plans for the new mine have been met with criticism by climate groups, who say they make an ""absolute mockery"" of its pledges to limit coal mining because of climate change. India is opening up dozens of coal mines to the private sector to ""turn the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity"" The dense jungles of Hasdeo Arand, in India's central Chhattisgarh state, are home to endangered species and the Gondi, one of India's original indigenous tribes. It is also the site of an estimated 5 billion metric tons of coal, which the mining industry is keen to tap into. The Gondis' long fight to save the forest, and their way of life, from destruction has just gotten more complicated. With the aim of making India ""self-reliant,"" boosting the economy wrecked by the coronavirus pandemic and getting thousands of people back to work, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in June that 41 new ""coal blocks"" across five states would be opened up to commercial mining. While five sensitive mining locations in the Hasdeo Arand were eventually withdrawn from Modi's list, the threat to the forest hasn't subsided. And the push for more coal mining also has the potential to divert India from its global commitments to reduce emissions at a time where the country is reeling from extreme weather and water shortages linked to the climate crisis.

The search for a cure is global but your chances of survival are local
Individual behavior saves lives but can't fix the problem
Humanity is capable of fast, sweeping changes

Federal officials are investigating utility equipment near the start of massive Bobcat Fire,"
                            Federal investigators looking into the origins of the massive Bobcat Fire are focusing on utility equipment owned by Southern California Edison (SCE) that experienced an issue moments before the fire was first reported. The fire, one of the largest wildfires in Los Angeles County history, started on September 6. It continues to burn in the mountains outside Los Angeles, torching more than 113,000 acres and sending a massive smoke plume over the region. The fire was about 39% contained Wednesday night, according to the Los Angeles County fire department. Edison spokesperson David Song told CNN the utility received a request from United States Forest Service (USFS) officials on September 15 to turn over a section of SCE's overhead conductor near Cogswell Dam. That's the area where the Bobcat Fire was sparked.  An incident report provided by Edison to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said an SCE circuit experienced a ""relay operation,"" which is like a circuit trip, at 12:16 p.m. on the day the fire started.  Five minutes later, at 12:21 p.m., a fire was first reported in the area. Song refuted any connection between the utility's equipment and the fire saying, ""The USFS said first reports of the fire were at 12:21pm. However, the Mt. Wilson camera first observed smoke at least as early as 12:10pm, prior to any activity on Edison's circuit."" Forest Service officials did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Fires still ravaging California  The thousands of wildfires that have charred 3.6 million acres of California land this year have killed 26 people since last month and destroyed more than 6,600 structures, fire officials say.  And at least 26 major wildfires continue to burn, with more than 18,200 firefighters battling the blazes.  Among the fires that are still active is the El Dorado Fire, which was sparked during a gender reveal party earlier this month. The fire has torched more than 22,000 acres and is now 74% contained.  In Northern California, the North Complex Fire has burned through more than a staggering 300,000 acres and is 78% contained. The fire has killed 15 people, according to CAL FIRE, and destroyed about 1,947 structures.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom has blamed the widespread blazes on climate change and on Wednesday, he issued an executive order requiring all new cars sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035. ""This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""For too many decades, we have allowed cars to pollute the air that our children and families breathe. Californians shouldn't have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma."" ""Our cars shouldn't make wildfires worse -- and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn't melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.""

Does the NFL know something that Trump doesn't?,"
                            If President Donald Trump's grievance-filled video rant to the UN General Assembly proved anything, it's that he doesn't really have a foreign policy. Trump lashed out at China and critics of his climate-change-denying environmental record, celebrated sparse diplomatic achievements and lied about the US fight against the pandemic. His speech encapsulated how he wields power abroad — in service of domestic and personal political goals, rather than based on a traditional calculation of wider US interests.  All Trump's foreign moves are expected to pull their political weight at home. When he wanted a trade deal with Beijing, Trump was Chinese President Xi Jinping's best friend — offering unwarranted praise over his pandemic leadership. But when his own disastrous handling of the virus threatened hopes of a second term, he chose China as a scapegoat even at the expense of triggering a new Cold War. The US pullout from the Iran nuclear deal left Tehran closer to a bomb, but it sure helped destroy Barack Obama's legacy. US-backed normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain also aimed to please evangelicals in the US. And while the President's love fest with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did nothing to dismantle his nukes, it yielded great photo ops. ""Only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for cooperation,"" Trump told the General Assembly, encapsulating his ""America First"" creed, which upends 80 years of US global leadership. If he loses the election in six weeks, his speech will be remembered as a defiant, valedictory swipe. And if Joe Biden takes Trump's place at the UN next year, he'll face a world grown skeptical of America's staying power -- and foes who made hay in its absence. 'Our own 1945 moment' Opening the day of leaders' speeches on Tuesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stuck a dark tone, calling the coronavirus pandemic and its effects ""our own 1945 moment"" -- a reference to the destruction of WWII. He also warned against the emerging US-China cold war, saying, ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture — each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities."" Monday Night Politics The NFL is hardly the most progressive organization in America. Yet the all-mighty football league has struck out in exactly the opposite direction to Trump on the pandemic and race -- suggesting that it thinks it understands something about the national moment that the President doesn't. Pigskin bosses just handed out $100,000 fines to three coaches for not wearing face masks on the sidelines. They also fined their teams, who are playing mostly without crowds -- unlike Trump in his campaign rallies. After shutting out Colin Kaepernick, who started a global movement by becoming the first player to take a knee to protest police brutality, the league has now taken a more accommodating view toward racial justice activism by players. One of the more reactionary teams, in Washington, has finally agreed that its previous Redskins branding is racially offensive.  With teams in more conservative areas, the NFL is sometimes caught between its players, who are disproportionately Black, and its fan base. Some of the few spectators allowed into games booed their own players over their demonstrations. Trump, meanwhile, is celebrating a dip in NFL ratings as proof that political correctness is ruining the country's most popular sport. Many of the teams' billionaire owners are conservative -- but if the league as a whole has any belief system, it's that they have an inalienable right to pile up billions of dollars in profits. The NFL, following the more inclusive NBA, NASCAR racing and other pro leagues, appears to have decided that its long-term business interests depend on being seen as open to the national reckoning on race. And if teams want to keep playing amid the pandemic, they can't skip protocols like social distancing and masks. Trump and the NFL have both shown an uncanny ability to read the public's mood. We'll soon see who was right.  Who said it? Every quote below was spoken by a different head of state at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. Write to meanwhile@cnn.com with your guess for each. ""We should see each other as members of the same big family, pursue win-win cooperation, and rise above ideological disputes and do not fall into the trap of 'clash of civilizations.' More importantly, we should respect a country's independent choice of development path and model.""
""The footage broadcast to the world concerning the treatment of an African American by the US police is reminiscent of our own experience. We instantly recognize that foot kneeling on the neck as the foot of arrogance on the neck of independent nations."" 
""here is no blood in the sand. Those days are hopefully over.""
""Geopolitical tensions continue to rise. Escalating tensions benefit no one. The new flashpoints heighten fears and tend to tear peoples apart. When elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled flat."" 
                        ",CNN.com,"{'output': ""Does the NFL know something that Trump doesn't? The NFL is the most popular team in the US and it's not a bad thing.\n\nThis, after all, is why the NFL is more popular than ever.\n\nBut I can't blame Trump for the league's success. He promised to put the game of baseball behind him. He promised to get rid of Goodell if he didn't care about the NFL.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen you compare the NFL numbers to what he did during the 2016 campaign, you'll notice that this is an NFL-wide comparison as opposed to what he did in the last election. I'll be comparing what we would expect in 2017, the year after the election. I'd say it takes about 70-90% of the league's games to win the presidency, it takes 10 years for a team to win the title, and it would take an eighth of the past 30 years (in terms of the amount of total games won, a new-ballot player's career is much longer than he's played) to win a league championship.\n\nI'm saying this after seeing all the media reports: The NBA was a little worse than the NFL in 2016 as soon as it launched, the same reason every other NFL football game is better. The NBA was a little worse when it launched, it wasn't even the NBA anymore. They were a little better after that, it didn't matter.\n\nAnd then this happens again, the same reason in the NBA. In 2017, in a few months we're going to have a new rule. This new rule may not help things but this will have a huge impact for the NBA. It will be a big-money thing and you will get a decent basketball team.\n\nSo if you take all this away, it's not like the league will give you anything. But if the league wanted to give you anything more, it will give you an NBA Finals basketball team in the postseason. I'm sure this would have a positive impact on it, but I believe that's too little-changed and this could easily be a reason for the league being in the 2018 Draft.\n\nI don't doubt this is a good thing for the NBA. It's a great organization, and it should be applauded, as well. A major issue here is for the NFL to win, not just in football but in general: the sport itself.\n\nIt's like this, because football is a great sport, and I think all the sports I love now, like baseball and basketball, are great. All the sports I loved in college and the country, and everything around me, have always been great. Football, just because it's not the way it's been portrayed in media, can still be a great sport.<|endoftext|>In May he met with several young gay activists who were arrested and detained by authorities who were trying to gather evidence, according to two Chicago police officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.\n\nThey were arrested a second time in early August to protest an ordinance that forbids police officers from arresting anyone they have arrested.\n\nPolice officers arrested their supporters — an activist, a pastor and a church leader — who had been attending protests outside the city's public library — and arrested several young gay activists before the mayor asked them to leave the building, the police official said as the group reached its final steps, including shutting down the library.\n\nPolice arrested five of the activists and confiscated five of their belongings and belongings, according to a police report.

Latest on 2020 election and SCOTUS battle,"
                            Vice President Mike Pence defended President Trump holding large rallies in an ABC News interview that airs Wednesday, saying it's happening because ""we're in an election year.""   ""President Trump and I trust the American people. We truly do believe in this freedom-loving nation that the American people know how to look after themselves, look after their families, and look after their neighbors and look out for the future of this country,"" he said. Asked by ABC if he's concerned about the optics of such events in the midst of a pandemic, Pence again said he believes that Americans can take care of themselves. ""The American people, really throughout the course of the last eight months, have demonstrated the ability to put the health of their family and their neighbors first,"" he said. The coronavirus pandemic has not subsided in the US, which has recorded more than 200,000 deaths from the virus.  On Amy Coney Barrett being a top contender for the SCOTUS job, Pence said, ""Judge Barrett is an extraordinary jurist. And she's among a number of women that are currently under consideration."" President Trump would not commit to saying he would provide a peaceful transition of power after Election Day.  “Well we’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster,” Trump said at a press briefing at the White House Wednesday evening.  “(G)et rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very … there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There’ll be a continuation,” he added. Trump said, “the ballots are out of control,” apparently referring to his unproven allegations that mail in ballots are somehow more vulnerable to fraud.  Facts First: While some sources estimate there will be around 80 million ballots submitted by mail this year, the President is wrong to suggest that they are all somehow unsolicited. In 41 of 50 states, voters have to request their ballot by mail before being sent one, with only a handful of states automatically sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters. There is no also factual basis for the claim that the left plans to use ""millions of fraudulent ballots"" or seeks to ""steal this election"" from Trump. The President himself has referred this week, also with no basis, to ""fake ballots."" Trump has made repeated false and misleading claims calling the integrity of the election into question.   Cindy McCain, the widow of longtime Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said Wednesday that lawmakers “working together civilly” is the only way for the US to move forward.  “Well, I think that there has been damage done,” McCain told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” when asked about President Trump’s effect on the Republican Party.  “But I believe in the great spirit of the United States of America and I think those things can be mended and healed. What has been missing here is this divisive attitude toward right and wrong on Capitol Hill. In many cases nobody is right or wrong, it is just a matter of opinion. And working together civilly is the only way that we can handle this.” Her comments come one day after she formally endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for president.  “I remember John as a young congressman working across the aisle with Tip O'Neill. They didn't agree on much of anything at all but the two of them remained friends because they respected each other and believed that they were doing it for the good of the country.”  “And that is the same with Joe Biden,” she added.  President Trump said he thinks it’s important to have nine Supreme Court justices prior to the election because the results of the election could wind up before the court. The President is expected to announce his nominee this Saturday.   “Yes, I think it’s very important. I think this will end up in the Supreme Court and I think it’s very important that we have nine justices,” Trump said on Wednesday. Trump said there is a lot of time to confirm a new justice to the high court since his term goes until January 20, “but I think it’s better if you go before the election because I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling, it’s a scam, this scam will be before the United States Supreme Court and I think having a four-four situation is not a good situation if you get that.”   Trump was referring to unsolicited ballots being sent to Americans which he mentioned earlier in his remarks. “I think it should be eight-nothing or nine-nothing, but just in case it would be more political than it should be, I think it’s very important to have a ninth justice,” Trump added. Of note, there were only eight justices at the time of the 2016 election. Trump said he’s confident that the Senate can confirm a new justice before November 3, noting that many of his potential nominees “just went through the process recently” for other judicial appointments. “I think the process is going to go very quickly. The hearing, I think Lindsey is going to call the date of the hearing… You can’t call it until you have the candidate and once you have the nominee, I will wait to hear what the date is, but from that point I would think we’d be fairly quick,” he said. Trump said most of the Republican senators have already made their intentions known on voting for a Supreme Court nominee. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also said there should be a vote on a new Supreme Court nominee before the election.  ##SCOTUS## Upset by the fact that they didn’t have prom as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and eager to mobilize around the 2020 election, a group of young organizers decided to link prom and voting. Youth organizers launched “Prom at the Polls” Tuesday, a nonpartisan initiative to energize young voters and inspire them to turnout on or ahead of November 3. The initiative encourages young people to make a “prom-poll-sal,” which organizers describe as “the action of asking someone to go to prom at the polls with you” and posting it to social media.  After making their “prom-poll-sal,” participants are encouraged to dress up as if they are going to prom when they cast their ballot – either by mail or in person – and document it on social media. Prom at the Polls, which launched on National Voter Registration Day, will host a livestream event on November 1, inviting voters and their dates to attend a pseudo-prom party.  The founding organizers of Prom at the Polls include a group of young activists who advocate for a number of issues voting rights, climate justice, immigration reform, and gun violence prevention.  The initiative’s organizers are Jerome Foster II, Randi Garcia, Santiago Mayer, Sophia Shapiro and Matthew Weinstein, who are all between the ages of 18 and 25. They were introduced by actress Alyssa Milano on September 8, organizers said, and immediately started to brainstorm ways to get out the youth vote. That led to Prom at the Polls. Milano, a leading activist in the #MeToo movement, is an advocate on a number of social issues.  “Voting is how we protect each other. I am so proud of this younger generation. They understand the importance of civic engagement and they are using their voices to inspire other young people to find their voices too,” Milano said in a statement Tuesday. Organizers bonded over the fact that they didn’t have prom this year, Jerome Foster, 18 and a freshman at Pace University, told CNN.  “We wanted to create an event that brings hope and joy to voting,” Foster said.  While there was high youth voter turnout in the 2018 midterms , Foster noted that not all registered voters hit the polls. He hopes Prom at the Polls will help maintain excitement between National Voter Registration Day and Election Day, ensuring that registered voters turn out in the 2020 election. Prom at the Polls is in talks to team up with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, as well as a number of celebrities and influencers who will help promote the initiative, Weinstein, 20, told CNN.  Vote.org will track the number of participants who register to vote as a result of the initiative. ""The youth vote comprises a significant portion of this year's electorate, and it is essential that these voices are heard,"" Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey said. ##Voting## Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made his first trip to North Carolina as the Democratic presidential nominee Wednesday afternoon, holding an ""economic summit"" in Charlotte with Black small business owners, educators, and working people. Wearing Ray-Bans as he kicked off remarks and carrying a white notecard he occasionally referenced, Biden introduced himself, joking “I’m Joe Biden, and I’m trying to get a job with Chris,” referring to NBA star Chris Paul, who introduced the former vice president.  Biden took issue with President Trump’s remarks that the virus affects “virtually nobody,” asking the audience to consider, “So you go home and your mom's gone, your dad's gone. He's a virtual nobody?”  Biden said that while the virus wasn’t Trump’s fault, his handling of it has “been close to criminal.” He addressed the systemic racism that has caused racial inequities, saying that “we have to break the cycle.”  “What I want to talk to you about today is that you know we have to break a cycle. The cycle that exists is that the African American community by and large finds itself at the bottom of the economic heap when businesses and others, when things are good. When things get bad, they're the first ones in the hole. When things get better, they're the last ones out,” he said.  He said the American people have finally seen the injustice as a result of the pandemic. “But the American people have all of a sudden, average people gone, ""My Lord, Holy-mackerel, I didn't know it was this bad."" A lot of them didn't know. A lot did. But a lot did know it was this bad,” he said.  Biden implored people to get out and vote. “The point is I believe we have a gigantic opportunity, a gigantic opportunity to fundamentally change the systemic racism and systemic problems that exist in our system. And I think we have to do it. But only one way to do it. We've got to show up and vote,” he said.  It takes 270 electoral votes to win the 2020 presidential election. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is campaigning today in the battleground state of North Carolina as Election Day quickly approaches.  CNN's John King breaks down the latest polls and where the candidates stand in their race to 270: Vice President Mike Pence and other federal health officials sought to impress upon governors Monday the importance of boosting confidence in an eventual coronavirus vaccine as President Trump continues to suggest one will be available before the election. Speaking on a weekly conference call, Pence acknowledged the fraught political climate but said the vaccine conversation should be viewed separately — though Trump himself has publicly floated the possibility a vaccine is available before Election Day.  ""I know we’re in an election season. Just as I have over the last seven or eight months, I’m leaving the politics outside,"" Pence said on the call. ""We are working around the clock to get a safe and effective vaccine available for the American people but what we need is two things: number one, we need you to be ready to distribute it. Number two, we need you to do your part to build public confidence that it will be a safe and effective vaccine. What we don’t want is people undermining confidence in the process,"" he went on. Polls have shown the number of Americans willing to take a vaccine once it is available declining. A survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation in September found a majority of Americans, 62%, believe political pressure from the Trump administration will cause the US Food and Drug Administration to rush approval of a coronavirus vaccine before Election Day. Pence sought to dispel those concerns with governors — ""No corners are going to be cut, ever,"" he said — and asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease specialist, to lay out the vaccine approval process. Some background: Fauci said multiple advisory panels would be consulted before a vaccine is approved, either for emergency use or a broader approval, and said all the scientific data would be made available for independent review. ""When we say that we feel confident that the process that has been put in place traditionally for making decisions as to the safety and efficacy of a vaccine are in place — and that’s the reason why I have said publicly that I feel confident,"" Fauci said. Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reiterated the appeal to governors to use their platforms to boost confidence in a vaccine. ""I don’t believe that access to the vaccine after the first of the year and into the beginning of the second quarter would be an issue,"" he said, ""but I am concerned, as the vice president stressed, about building public confidence."" ""Our biggest challenge, and what I would ask the leadership of each of you have, is to build that culture of confidence in vaccination,"" he said. ""Once doubt sets in, it’s going to be very hard for us to reverse that in different populations."" ##Coronavirus## Two Republicans in Minnesota, with the support of the Honest Elections Project, are suing the state for extending the deadline for absentee ballots to be received amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In August, a judge in Minnesota approved changes eliminating the state’s requirement that voters get a notary or witness to sign their ballot envelope, and allows for absentee ballots to be counted if they are postmarked on or before Election Day and received by 8 p.m. within one week of Election Day. The previous rule was that ballots had to be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Honest Elections Project said in a news release that this change “puts the credibility of the election in jeopardy, and violates the law,” and the group calls out other swing states that have already taken this action as well. “Liberal groups are looking to repeat this strategy in other battleground states. Already, courts have rewritten ballot receipt laws in Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” the release said. Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, called this change in Minnesota “a senseless recipe for disaster.” The suit, filed Tuesday in Minnesota Federal Court, asks for injunctions that would prevent ballots received after Election Day from being counted. “This plan will cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election’s results, and force litigation that could drag on for weeks. If Minnesota cannot certify its election results by December, it may be excluded from the Electoral College—disenfranchising the entire state. In other words, this is a senseless recipe for disaster,” Snead said. The two plaintiffs in the case are nominees to be Republican Party electors for Minnesota. Some background: CNN previously reported that the Honest Elections Project is a nonprofit group tied to influential conservatives who worked closely with PresidentTrump to elevate two Supreme Court justices.  It is pushing key states to “clean up” their voting rolls — a practice voting-rights groups and Democrats argue seeks to ""purge"" legitimate voters. The group is supporting a lawsuit against Michigan — where Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes -- that claims the state has an ""impossibly high"" high voter registration rate.  Understanding mail-in voting in the US ##Voting## Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that he will start preparing ""heavily"" for the debates beginning tomorrow. The first presidential debate is set to take place next Tuesday.  Speaking to reporters about the Supreme Court vacancy before boarding his flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, this morning, Biden said that Democrats need to ""make it clear"" what will happen if the Republican nominee for Ginsburg replacement is confirmed, listing threats to women's health care rights and the Affordable Care Act.  ""We should be out there campaigning on what’s going to happen,"" he said. ""Women will be able to be charged more than men for the same procedures again. Pregnancy will be a pre-existing condition again. We’ve got to go to the American people and make the case why this is a gigantic mistake and abuse of power.” On China, a nation Biden called a ""competitor"" during CNN's town hall, the Democratic presidential nominee said that he does not believe that relations will be ""zero-sum,"" and added that he does intend call out China's human rights violations and militarization of the South China Sea.  President Barack Obama on Wednesday urged Americans to text him with their plans to vote in the upcoming election.  In a tweet, Obama listed a phone number and said: ""All right, let's try something new. If you’re in the United States, send me a text at 773-365-9687 — I want to hear how you're doing, what's on your mind, and how you're planning on voting this year. I'll be in touch from time to time to share what's on my mind, too.” Sending a text message to the phone number results in an automated response from Obama, as well as a hyperlink to Community, a text message-based social network. ""Hey! It's Barack,” the response says. ""Click the link to sign up so I can respond directly to you. I won't be able to get to everything, but I'll be in touch to share what's on my mind and I want to hear from you, too. Let's do this."" Fast Company reported Wednesday that Obama and his team are using Community to energize voters — part of a wider effort to reach Americans on as many platforms as possible.  Community’s website lists celebrities such as Jared Leto and Alyssa Milano as verified users.  See Obama's tweet:  ##Voting##  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden joined The Steve Harvey Morning Show Wednesday for a wide-ranging interview touching on the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the vacancy in the Supreme Court, his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and his plan for Black Americans.  Biden, who made a direct plea to Republican senators to listen to their conscience in remarks Sunday, said that Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski ""had the guts"" to announce that the nomination of Ginsburg's replacement should wait until the election is over.  ""There's two people who have announced, who had the guts to announce that they will wait for election is over and shouldn’t vote then, and that is the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Maine and both women,"" Biden said. ""But there's a couple of others, if two others stand up and do the right thing, then it’ll be put off until the election.""  He said that rushing a nomination is a ""fundamental violation of the constitutional principal."" Asked by Harvey if it is ""legal"" for the President to appoint someone, Biden replied that Trump can legally appoint someone (""it's his right, technically""), but added that ""it’s a violation of the constitutional – under the underlying rationale – he can name somebody he wants to be the nominee but all those Republicans including the Majority Leader McConnell from Kentucky said that you shouldn't appoint anybody in an election year.""  On his and Sen. Harris' plan for Black Americans, Biden reiterated the crux of his plan, which is the importance of putting Black men and women in a position where they are able to accumulate wealth. ""Where they are in a position where they can begin to actually have the place in the community where as a people across the board, they grow the middle class,"" he said.  Biden praised Harris as his running mate and said that she would be ready to assume the presidency if anything were to happen to him.  ""She is so good. She is so good. She’s so damn bright and knowledgeable. I mean she’s ready to be president on day one if I – if somebody pushed me off a roof or something,"" he said.  Asked how to combat voter suppression, Biden encouraged listeners to visit ""iwillvote.com"" as a resource and warned that the administration will do ""everything in their power"" to keep people from voting, ""but they're not going to be stopped.""  ""The top line is: people in this country are going to be heard, no matter how much the President tries to stop them,"" Biden said. ""The African American people can determine this election.""  There’s nothing new about voting by mail. Americans have been doing it since the Civil War, and many states primarily vote by mail to this day.  But this year, Covid-19 is pushing many states to expand those efforts. And with that expansion has come confusion about how the process works.  Today on CNN's Election 101 podcast, we’re answering all your questions about voting by mail with Tammy Patrick, a senior advisor to the elections team at the Democracy Fund. Listen here. ##Voting## Cindy McCain joined all three morning shows Wednesday to discuss her endorsement of Joe Biden, leaning heavily into his character and empathy in her pitch for the Democratic candidate. McCain said that she is hoping to reach suburban women who may be on the fence with her voice.  In an interview on NBC’s Today Show, McCain said his empathy played a key factor in her decision to support the Democratic presidential nominee. “I want to feel like my president cares about me and cares about my country and Joe Biden does,” she said, later adding “Joe has great empathy for people in this country.”  McCain, who narrated a video about her husband and Biden’s friendship for the DNC, said the Atlantic report on President Trump’s denigrating comments about veterans and those killed in battle was “pretty much” the last straw for her when making the decision to endorse. “It’s a combination of things, but I do believe that our men and women that served in the military are not losers and certainly the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice are not losers,” she said. “I think that respect for the men and women who serve us and served this nation and protect us it’s important that we respect and care for them.” Asked if she’s disappointed in Lindsey Graham and other Republicans in their ardent support of Trump, she said “No. Lindsey is an old and very dear friend and I will always love him and he’s like a member of my family. Republicans that are – that believe and are doing what they’re doing, it’s certainly their prerogative to do so, I just believe things should be different.”  McCain said she hopes her husband is “happy with what I’m doing and believes that I’ve done the right thing.” She told ABC's Good Morning America that she intends to be actively campaigning. ""Yes, yes, of course. I'm hoping that I can convince suburban women who are kind of on the fence about things to come with me on this and step by step out of their comfort zone and join Team Biden,"" she said.  McCain, a lifelong Republican, said on ABC that while she and Biden disagree on some issues, that ""it's ok to disagree, and you can do it and be amenable and kind to each other,"" likening it to the friendship Biden had with her late husband.  Watch:  During a Good Morning America interview on Wednesday, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams advised the public to wear masks, in response to being asked about President  Trump's packed rally last night.  ""I've got Democrats who want me to condemn people who are out at a presidential rally. I've got Republicans who want me to condemn people who are going to vigils. And at the end of the day, the virus doesn't care about your politics,"" Adams said. ""It doesn't care what you're going out for. It only cares whether or not you're following public health measures. So, what I would say to everyone, politics aside: Wear a mask."" When asked why Americans are increasingly skeptical of a coronavirus vaccine, Adams said it’s because the situation has become politicized. ""I think it's become politicized. And it's important for people to understand we have a process. We have a data safety monitoring board. We have institutional review boards. We have independent people who are going to look at safety and efficacy before it ever gets to the point of approval or authorization. And I will be in line to get that vaccine when they tell me I can, and when it's safe and it's effective,"" Adams said.  ##Coronavirus## We're now less than 45 days until the election, so it shouldn't surprise you that we're talking about the state of Florida. The Sunshine State has arguably been the swingiest of the swing states over the last 25 years. This year, however, Florida looks to take on added importance. The outcome in Florida could help determine whether Election Night turns into Election Week or even potentially Election Month. A record number of voters are expected to vote by absentee or mail this year. About half of Democratic voters nationwide say they'll be voting by mail, up from about a quarter in 2016. Fewer than 25% of Republicans say they'll cast a ballot by mail. This wide gap is no doubt driven in part by President Donald Trump's largely false rhetoric about voting by mail. In Florida, this gap in voting style won't make much of a difference in terms of when we know the winner. All ballots, with just a few exceptions, must be received at poll closing time by the county boards of elections. Those ballots are usually counted before those cast on Election Day. The state also has a long history of voting by mail. About 30% of the vote in 2016 was cast by mail. As long as the vote is not exceedingly tight in Florida, we'll have a good indication of who has won the Sunshine State on Election Night. If we know who has won in Florida, we'll have a good idea of what to expect from the rest of the country. At this point, former Vice President Joe Biden holds a slim polling lead there. As I've noted before, Florida has voted with the winner in every election since 1996 and all but two since 1924. In both those cases, it was Democrats who took the presidency without Florida. This year, it's pretty clear that Trump has very few paths to the White House without winning Florida. It's possible, but it isn't really realistic. Read the full analysis here.  Multiple sources familiar tell CNN that both the White House and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham are targeting the week of Oct. 12 for the nominee’s confirmation hearing.  That would allow for a confirmation vote by Oct. 29, hitting a pre-election timeline that the White House and congressional Republicans are increasingly coalescing behind.  Plans have not been finalized and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not laid out an explicit timeline to this point. But sources say he’s involved in the conversations and hasn’t objected to the prospect of a pre-election conformation.  The Supreme Court term starts on Oct. 5 and some big cases are scheduled for the fall, including oral arguments on the Affordable Care Act on Nov. 10.   ##SCOTUS## The first presidential debate between Joe Biden and President Trump will be moderated by Fox News' Chris Wallace and is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. Wallace selected the following topics for the first debate, according to the Commission on Presidential Debate: ""The Trump and Biden Records"" 
""The Supreme Court,"" ""Covid-19"" 
""The Economy,"" ""Race and Violence in our Cities"" 
""The Integrity of the Election"" Each segment will last about 15 minutes, and the candidates will have two minutes to respond after the moderator opens each segment with a question.  Wallace will then use the rest of the time in the segment to facilitate further discussion on the topic, according to the commission. Read more about the scheduled debates here.

California governor wants all new cars sold in the state to be zero-emissions by 2035,"
                            California Governor Gavin Newsom announced an executive order Wednesday requiring that all new passenger cars and trucks sold in the state be zero-emission vehicles by 2035.  The effort is aimed at curbing carbon emissions in the country's most populous state and addressing the climate change crisis. The transportation sector is responsible for more than half of the state's carbon pollution, according to Newsom's office.  The announcement comes after Californians have for weeks been battered by an unprecedented wildfire season. The vast majority of scientists agree that climate change-driven disasters will inevitably increase.  ""This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,"" Newsom said in a release. ""Californians shouldn't have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma. Our cars shouldn't make wildfires worse — and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn't melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines."" The order relates only to new car sales. It would not prevent Californians from owning or driving gasoline-powered cars, or buying or selling them on the used car market, according to the release.  It's unclear exactly how the order will be implemented. Following the order, the California Air Resources Board has been charged with developing new regulations mandating that all in-state sales of passenger cars and trucks be zero-emission by 2035. The board is also developing regulations that would require all medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to go emissions-free by 2045 ""where feasible,"" though the mandate stays at 2035 for harbor shipping operations vehicles.  In order for the mandate to be carried out, the release said California state agencies will partner with the private sector to develop the infrastructure to support what would likely amount to more widespread usage of electric vehicles, such as more charging stations throughout the state.  The order is a bold move that would follow the lead of several cities and countries around the world. California would be the US state to implement such a policy.  But it's likely to be unpopular with at least some auto manufacturers — the switch to widespread production of all-electric vehicles, while already underway for most major manufacturers, is costly — and they could could challenge the order in court.  Then again, the order could be just the kind of push needed to get the auto industry moving more aggressively toward a strategy centered on electric vehicles, according to Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds, an online resource for car data. ""The automotive industry was already on the road toward electrification as a long term goal, but many automakers have been guilty of setting short term targets for their electrification strategy that never came to fruition,"" Caldwell said in an emailed comment. ""This rule, if implemented, establishes a specific timeline that they'll collectively need to adhere to. California is a major market that automakers desperately need to maintain sales within to ensure their own viability."" Newsom's order also comes in the midst of California's court battle with the Trump administration over the state's ability to set its own emissions standards, which could be another hurdle for the order's implementation.  There is also a question of affordability and equity for low-income communities, as electric cars tend to be more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts, at least for now. The governor's press release announcing the order noted that, ""zero-emission vehicles will almost certainly be cheaper and better than the traditional fossil fuel powered cars"" by the time the rule goes into effect.  In a press conference about the order Wednesday, Newsom's staff also pointed to private sector developments, such as a prediction by Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tuesday that more efficient batteries will be mainstream in the next three to four years, which would significantly reduce the costs of electric vehicles.

Hickenlooper attacks Gardner over Supreme Court vacancy in Colorado Senate race,"
                            Former Gov. John Hickenlooper attacked Sen. Cory Gardner in a new ad released Wednesday, charging that the Colorado Republican is ""ready to rush through a Supreme Court justice at lightning speed"" rather than address a host of other issues. The ad is one of the first in the country to invoke the fight over Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's successor, underscoring how Democrats view the vacancy as a political winner in blue states, where the party base is furious at Republicans for moving forward to confirm a nominee and shift the Court even further to the right. ""Cory Gardner has taken no action to lower health care costs, lower prescription drug prices, rebuild our infrastructure, fight climate change or provide economic relief in this pandemic for five months,"" says Hickenlooper in the ad. ""But boy oh boy, Cory is ready to rush through a Supreme Court justice at lightning speed."" ""The next court will decide whether to rip up protections for people with pre-existing conditions, whether women still have a right to choose, and really what justice means in this country,"" he adds. Gardner is one of the most vulnerable Republican senators in the country, running in a state that went for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by five points in the 2016 presidential race. His campaign did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. It's a Tilt Democratic race, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.   In March 2016, Gardner, like almost every other Republican senator, supported blocking then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, from filling the seat left by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. ""Our next election is too soon and the stakes are too high; the American people deserve a role in this process as the next Supreme Court Justice will influence the direction of this country for years to come,"" he said at the time. After Ginsburg's death on Friday, the Colorado senator quickly backed the Senate Republican strategy to consider Trump's to-be-announced nominee to replace her even though Election Day is less than six weeks away. ""I have and will continue to support judicial nominees who will protect our Constitution, not legislate from the bench, and uphold the law,"" said Gardner in a statement earlier this week. ""Should a qualified nominee who meets this criteria be put forward, I will vote to confirm."" It's unclear exactly how the vacancy will affect the fight for control of the Senate. Democrats are confident that it will help them in blue states like Colorado and Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins faces a tough reelection race, while Republicans are confident it will help them in red states like Montana. If Sen. Doug Jones loses in deep red Alabama, Democrats needs to win four seats and the White House to take control of the chamber.  Democratic Senate candidates including Hickenlooper have advocated for fulfilling Ginsburg's ""most fervent wish"" to not be replaced until after the next presidential inauguration, when a President Joe Biden could choose her replacement. Democrats have no power to block a nearly unified Senate Republican majority, but are warning voters that a Supreme Court with six conservative justices could dismantle the Affordable Care Act and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The Court hears a crucial case on the law's constitutionality a week after Election Day. Gardner has defended himself from attacks over his support to repeal the ACA, saying in an ad that he'll protect people with pre-existing conditions like his mother, ""no matter what happens to Obamacare."" His campaign also aired a new ad on Wednesday, referencing an infamous ad Hickenlooper ran in 2010, in which the Democrat took a shower with his clothes on because he couldn't stand all the negative ads. ""Now, it's Hickenlooper who's running nasty ads,"" says Gardner in his ad, as he leaves a shower wearing a blue shirt and tie. ""You and I may not always agree, but I stay true and work hard for Colorado.

(However, in the context of the country, it is quite evident that the economy of the country does not depend on the nationalization, but on the nationalization.)\n\n""I have been very impressed by the fact that the nationalization of an institution also is not necessarily just about having the national treasury and it\'s not always that much in tension of the particular moment and particular economic themes that we have,"" he responded.\n\nThe President\'s assertion about the nationalization of one industry was the only instance of the administration\'s policy making because there was not going to be any sort of tax policy. The UPA was trying to promote economic activity, not necessarily reduce it.\n\nIt\'s not clear what exactly those elements included, he said of the idea to eliminate ""financial establishments"": real estate owned by Indians, banks, insurance companies, investment trusts not owned by investors or VC funds, etc.\n\nRaghu\'s argument, I said in response, is that it is an exercise in politics and policy as well as a public relations enterprise, which means that any action taken by Congress in the way they are being portrayed has its own agenda and the motive to push foreign policy ideas. But there is no such a thing as political aplism that\'s always been used to an extent in the UPA: this is a public relations enterprise at all.\n\n""The fact that there are political ideas in the country and that there should be political views in the country that are interesting to say, for instance, foreign policy and finance, doesn\'t really exist,"" I said. And you\'re right, he went on. ""But I guess the fact that there are not many political ideas actually does not mean that politics is not important.""\n\n""I am happy with the fact that we have a national agenda and that the country is a much more humane society than some of those in the UPA,"" I said. ""This is what I think is the case even if it\'s only because you see the economic situation really where the domestic environment is not as it is in', 'id': '8cd03ab2-8e1b-4956-bfb8-982be9b4bc0a'}",DeepAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How Biden differs from Trump's 'America First' mentality,"
                            President Donald Trump advocates an ""America First"" mentality, at times putting him at odds with allies. Joe Biden promotes strengthening global alliances to tackle threats like climate change and authoritarianism.

""His speech, my friends at Liberty University, he spoke in detail about the world we are living in. What a great nation this guy could have.""\n\nIt\'s not an idealist stance for this nation, just like Trump had not expressed in his speech so far.\n\nOne person speaking on the Trump transition has said that he was ""very impressed"" with the speech and ""fantastic"" by the ""beautiful crowd, incredible people"".\n\nAnother person speaking on Tuesday said: ""He spoke beautifully about being the new guy in the world – we just need a better president, we\'ll be there at a moment.""\n\nTrump told reporters in Cincinnati Tuesday that he is grateful for ""his speech, it was a phenomenal experience, a memorable speech.""\n\nIn his speech, Trump cited a report in Time published by The Hill detailing the speech at Liberty University, where a majority of people say Trump had ""satisfied"" the young graduates.\n\n""It really hit me tonight I\'m grateful...and it was a very nice speech, I was very impressed with Donald Trump."" Trump told reporters in Cincinnati.\n\nHe added: ""I\'ve heard this man saying that, \'I\'m not going to let anyone hurt you.\'""\n\nAnd there was no mention of a ""noble, beautiful speech"" by his ""noble, beautiful"" fellow U.S. President in Cincinnati, despite the fact that in a few places and a few days, Trump told reporters, ""It probably would have had a very different atmosphere had he said that, \'I\'m not going to let anyone hurt you.\'""\n\nTrump then went on to say that he hoped the people at Liberty University would follow his lead in promoting free education.\n\n""I think they were the first to hear it. I think they were the first to see it. I\'m glad they didn\'t, people have been talking about it,"" he said. ""People have been talking about this thing for a while. I think it definitely had a good influence on people.""<|endoftext|>A Canadian man convicted of the slaying of his girlfriend\'s father and his friend\'s daughter has confessed to killing his family\'s son with his killer Christi the Ruger of the U.S.\n\nA Canadian man confessed to killing his family\'s son with a serial killer who was previously unknown, according to a lawyer who spoke to CBC News on condition of anonymity.\n\nDinondae Haines had been killed in a series of attacks in the northeastern province of Chatham Rise this morning, when he collapsed four times in the front of the same car.\n\nThe car was seized at the scene and the victim was buried the next day in the mountains across the border into Chatham-Kent, where police searched for the body.\n\nThe man, who was arrested Monday, confessed to killing his older brother and another man in an effort to help him from other people\'s reaction to the suicide. The second man, 31, was also arrested for killing his mother, a friend for six.\n\nThe man was not arrested under manslaughter or special conditions of the time of death. Police also did not have a warrant issued for any particular crimes, including those in the killing of Elsanna Haines.\n\nIt remains unclear what is at the heart of the case.\n\nHaines was one of three killings in Chatham-Kent, where Montreal police say he was the victim of a shooting a year ago.\n\nA national police search last week turned up nothing to indicate that the killer, or anyone else linked to him, had killed himself.\n\nTwo other victims are still missing, and when police searched the site of the shootings, they said there was evidence of illegal aggression and a potential witness who called police, according to officers at the scene.\n\nHe was killed in a shooting incident in the city of Montreal as a result of his killing, police said Monday.\n\nA 19-year-old man named Jean-François de Rugers, who is a neighbour of the truck shooter during the morning rush hour at Chatham-Kent, died at the scene.\n\nA man named Rick Chatham was charged with first-degree murder and is believed to be in the process of recovering from his excessive injuries.\n\nChatham police say the case comes back to have been released. They are offering grief counseling and are giving their devastated family some closure regarding the case.\n\nPolice and prosecutors are meeting with relatives who have questioned the killers, and the person who killed Haines, asking:\n\n""Are you sure, right now that he is dead and left to go to prison?""<|endoftext|>It was all in a panic — a chaotic mix of anxiety and panic.\n\nIn fact, there was a long line of victims among them.
